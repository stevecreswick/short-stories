Smiley, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that _Leonidas W_. Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous _Jim Smiley_, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded."," I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named _Leonidas W_. Smiley--_Rev. Leonidas W._ Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of Angel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him."," Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in _finesse_. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once."," \"Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here once by the name of _Jim_ Smiley, in the winter of '49--or may be it was the spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit _him_--any way just so's he got a bet, _he_ was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and he was, too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he _was_ going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to _him_--he'd bet on _any_ thing--the dangest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nit' mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, Well, I'll risk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'\""," Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down."," And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'-castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what _he_ was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was _his_ fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it, because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out."," Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he _did_ learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing out, \"Flies, Dan'l, flies!\" and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever _they_ see."," Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller--a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:"," \"What might be that you've got in the box?\""," And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, \"It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.\""," And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and says, \"H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's _he_ good for?\""," \"Well,\" Smiley says, easy and careless, \"he's good enough for _one_ thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.\""," The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, \"Well,\" he says, \"I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.\""," \"Maybe you don't,\" Smiley says. \"Maybe you understand frogs and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got _my_ opinion and I'll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.\""," And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, \"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog, I'd bet you.\""," And then Smiley says, \"That's all right--that's all right--if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.\" And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait."," So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot--filled! him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:"," \"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his forepaws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.\" Then he says, \"One--two--three--_git_!\" and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course."," The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, \"Well,\" he says, \"_I_ don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.\""," Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last says, \"I do wonder what in the nation that frog throwed off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.\" And he ketched Dan'l up by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, \"Why blame my cats if he don't weigh five pounds!\" and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And----"," (Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he said: \"Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going to be gone a second.\""," But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond _Jim_ Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. _Leonidas W._ Smiley, and so I started away."," At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:"," \"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and----\""," However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about the afflicted cow, but took my leave."],"excerpt":"In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from\nthe East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and\ninquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W.

The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story."," It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever."," Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept."," Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily."," I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --\"Who's there?\""," I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall."," Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --\"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor,\" or \"It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.\" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room."," When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye."," It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot."," And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage."," But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more."," If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs."," I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha!"," When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises."," I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim."," The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears."," No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!"," \"Villains!\" I shrieked, \"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!\""],"excerpt":"TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?

Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, _au troisičme_, No. 33 Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence, while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogęt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G----, the Prefect of the Parisian police."," We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G----'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble."," \"If it is any point requiring reflection,\" observed Dupin, as he forebore to enkindle the wick, \"we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.\""," \"That is another of your odd notions,\" said the Prefect, who had the fashion of calling everything \"odd\" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of \"oddities.\""," \"Very true,\" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled toward him a comfortable chair."," \"And what is the difficulty now?\" I asked. \"Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope?\""," \"Oh no, nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is _very_ simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively _odd_.\""," \"Simple and odd,\" said Dupin."," \"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether.\""," \"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,\" said my friend."," \"What nonsense you _do_ talk!\" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily."," \"Perhaps the mystery is a little _too_ plain,\" said Dupin."," \"Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\""," \"A little _too_ self-evident.\""," \"Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!\" roared our visitor, profoundly amused, \"Oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\""," \"And what, after all, _is_ the matter on hand?\" I asked."," \"Why, I will tell you,\" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. \"I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I confided it to any one.\""," \"Proceed,\" said I."," \"Or not,\" said Dupin."," \"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.\""," \"How is this known?\" asked Dupin."," \"It is clearly inferred,\" replied the Prefect, \"from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing _out_ of the robber's possession--that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.\""," \"Be a little more explicit,\" I said."," \"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable.\" The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy."," \"Still I do not quite understand,\" said Dupin."," \"No? Well, the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of the most exalted station, and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.\""," \"But this ascendancy,\" I interposed, \"would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--\""," \"The thief,\" said G----, \"is the Minister D----, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question--a letter, to be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal _boudoir_. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D----. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The Minister decamped, leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.\""," \"Here, then,\" said Dupin to me, \"you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.\""," \"Yes,\" replied the Prefect, \"and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me.\""," \"Than whom,\" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \"no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.\""," \"You flatter me,\" replied the Prefect; \"but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.\""," \"It is clear,\" said I, \"as you observe, that the letter is still in the possession of the Minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs.\""," \"True,\" said G----; \"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the Minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.\""," \"But,\" said I, \"you are quite _au fait_ in these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing often before.\""," \"Oh yes, and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the Minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D---- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.\""," \"But is it not possible,\" I suggested, \"that although the letter may be in the possession of the Minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\""," \"This is barely possible,\" said Dupin. \"The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D---- is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.\""," \"Its susceptibility of being produced?\" said I."," \"That is to say, of being _destroyed_,\" said Dupin."," \"True,\" I observed; \"the paper is clearly, then, upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the Minister, we may consider that as out of the question.\""," \"Entirely,\" said the Prefect. \"He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigidly searched under my own inspection.\""," \"You might have spared yourself this trouble,\" said Dupin. \"D----, I presume, is not altogether a fool; and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.\""," \"Not _altogether_ a fool,\" said G----; \"but, then, he is a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.\""," \"True,\" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, \"although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.\""," \"Suppose you detail,\" said I, \"the particulars of your search.\""," \"Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by room, devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police-agent, such a thing as a '_secret_' drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.\""," \"Why so?\""," \"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.\""," \"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\" I asked."," \"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise.\""," \"But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces _all_ articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?\""," \"Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing--any unusual gaping in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.\""," \"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the curtains and carpets.\""," \"That, of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.\""," \"The two houses adjoining!\" I exclaimed. \"You must have had a great deal of trouble.\""," \"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.\""," \"You include the _grounds_ about the houses?\""," \"All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed.\""," \"You looked among D----'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?\""," \"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-_cover_, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.\""," \"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?\""," \"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope.\""," \"And the paper on the walls?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"You looked into the cellars?\""," \"We did.\""," \"Then,\" I said, \"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is _not_ upon the premises, as you suppose.\""," \"I fear you are right there,\" said the Prefect. \"And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?\""," \"To make a thorough research of the premises.\""," \"That is absolutely needless,\" replied G----. \"I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the hotel.\""," \"I have no better advice to give you,\" said Dupin. \"You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?\""," \"Oh yes!\" And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external, appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before."," In about a month afterward he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair, and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said:"," \"Well, but, G----, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister?\""," \"Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin suggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.\""," \"How much was the reward offered, did you say?\" asked Dupin."," \"Why, a very great deal--a _very_ liberal reward--I don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing I _will_ say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.\""," \"Why, yes,\" said Dupin, drawling, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, \"I really--think, G----, you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think; eh?\""," \"How?--in what way?\""," \"Why\"--puff, puff--\"you might\"--puff, puff--\"employ counsel in the matter, eh\"--puff, puff, puff. \"Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?\""," \"No; hang Abernethy!\""," \"To be sure! Hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual.\""," \"'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would _you_ have directed him to take?'"," \"'Take!' said Abernethy. 'Why, take _advice_, to be sure.'\""," \"But,\" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \"_I_ am _perfectly_ willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would _really_ give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\""," \"In that case,\" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, \"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\""," I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an _escritoire_, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check."," When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanation."," \"The Parisian police,\" he said, \"are exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G---- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D----, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation--so far as his labors extended.\""," \"So far as his labors extended?\" said I."," \"Yes,\" said Dupin. \"The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.\""," I merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said."," \"The measures, then,\" he continued, \"were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand, and many a school-boy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course, he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'Are they even or odd?' Our school-boy replies, 'Odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself: 'The simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus;"," 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even'; he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the school-boy, whom his fellows termed 'Lucky,' what, in its last analysis, is it?\""," \"It is merely,\" I said, \"an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.\""," \"It is,\" said Dupin; \"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the _thorough_ identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked, is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the school-boy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.\""," \"And the identification,\" I said, \"of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.\""," \"For its practical value it depends upon this,\" replied Dupin; \"and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their _own_ ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which _they_ would have hidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of _the mass_; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of _practice_, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of D----, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions retarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he had taken it for granted that _all_ men proceed to conceal a letter, not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg, but, at least, in _some_ out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see, also, that such _recherché_ nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this _recherché_ manner--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance--or, when the reward is of magnitude--the qualities in question have _never_ been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination--in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect _feels_; and he is merely guilty of a _non distributio medii_ in thence inferring that all poets are fools. I mean to say, that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold _intriguant_. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary political modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as _ruses_, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G----, in fact, did finally arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of political action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary _nooks_ of concealment. _He_ could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to _simplicity_, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so _very_ self-evident.\""," \"Yes,\" said I, \"I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.\""," \"The material world,\" continued Dupin, \"abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the _vis inertiae_, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true, in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent _momentum_ is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed, and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention?\""," \"I have never given the matter a thought,\" I said."," \"There is a game of puzzles,\" he resumed, \"which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of town, river, state, or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it."," \"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D----; upon the fact that the document must always have been _at hand_, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search, the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it."," \"Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel. I found D---- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of _ennui_. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when nobody sees him."," \"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host."," \"I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion."," \"At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six soiled cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the D---- cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D----, the Minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack."," \"No sooner had I glanced at this letter than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D---- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S---- family. Here the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the _radicalness_ of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the _true_ methodical habits of D----, and so consistent of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document--these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived--these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to suspect."," \"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention riveted upon the letter. In this examination I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack, and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more _chafed_ than seemed necessary. They presented the _broken_ appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good-morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table."," \"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D---- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the mean time I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a _facsimile_ (so far as regards externals), which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings--imitating the D---- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread."," \"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D---- came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterward I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.\""," \"But what purpose had you,\" I asked, \"in replacing the letter by a _facsimile_? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly and departed?\""," \"D----,\" replied Dupin, \"is a desperate man and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the _facilis descensus Averni_; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. He is that _monstrum horrendum_, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter I left for him in the card-rack.\""," \"How? Did you put anything particular in it?\""," \"Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--that would have been insulting. D----, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clew. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words:","   \"'----   ...

C, to the city of New York, in the fine packet-ship \"Independence,\" Captain Hardy.  We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June), weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to arrange some matters in my stateroom."," I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies.  On the list were several of my acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship.  He had been with me a fellow-student at C---- University, where we were very much together.  He had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm.  To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom."," I observed that his name was carded upon THREE state-rooms; and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters--his own.  The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other.  These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were THREE staterooms for these four persons.  I was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a variety of ill- bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary stateroom.  It was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma.  At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before.  \"It is a servant of course,\" I said; \"what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!\"  And then I again repaired to the list--but here I saw distinctly that NO servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one--for the words \"and servant\" had been first written and then over-scored.  \"Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,\" I now said to myself--\"something he wishes not to be put in the hold-- something to be kept under his own eye--ah, I have it--a painting or so--and this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew.\"  This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce."," Wyatt's two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were.  His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her.  He had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm.  He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment.  I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance."," On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt and party were also to visit it--so the captain informed me--and I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of being presented to the bride, but then an apology came.  \"Mrs. W. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.\""," The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, \"owing to circumstances\" (a stupid but convenient phrase), \"he rather thought the 'Independence' would not sail for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know.\"  This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as \"the circumstances\" were not forthcoming, although I pumped for them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure."," I did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week.  It came at length, however, and I immediately went on board.  The ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon making sail.  Wyatt's party arrived in about ten minutes after myself.  There were the two sisters, the bride, and the artist--the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy.  I was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention.  He did not even introduce me to his wife;--this courtesy devolving, per force, upon his sister Marian-- a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few hurried words, made us acquainted."," Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly astonished.  I should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman.  When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal."," The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a decidedly plain-looking woman.  If not positively ugly, she was not, I think, very far from it.  She was dressed, however, in exquisite taste-- and then I had no doubt that she had captivated my friend's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul.  She said very few words, and passed at once into her state-room with Mr. W."," My old inquisitiveness now returned.  There was NO servant--THAT was a settled point.  I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage. After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected.  Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea."," The box in question was, as I say, oblong.  It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it attentively, and like to be precise.  Now this shape was PECULIAR; and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing.  I had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:--and now here was a box, which, from its shape, COULD possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo's \"Last Supper;\" and a copy of this very \"Last Supper,\" done by Rubini the younger, at Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of Nicolino.  This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently settled.  I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen.  It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter.  I resolved to quiz him WELL, now and hereafter."," One thing, however, annoyed me not a little.  The box did NOT go into the extra stateroom.  It was deposited in Wyatt's own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor--no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife;--this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor.  On the lid were painted the words--\"Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New York.  Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq.  This side up.  To be handled with care.\""," Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the artist's wife's mother,--but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself.  I made up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in Chambers Street, New York."," For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast.  The passengers were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social.  I MUST except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the party.  Wyatt's conduct I did not so much regard.  He was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit--in fact he was MOROSE--but in him I was prepared for eccentricity.  For the sisters, however, I could make no excuse.  They secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused, although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on board."," Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable.  That is to say, she was CHATTY; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea.  She became EXCESSIVELY intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men.  She amused us all very much.  I say \"amused\"--and scarcely know how to explain myself.  The truth is, I soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed AT than WITH.  The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her \"a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.\"  The great wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match.  Wealth was the general solution--but this I knew to be no solution at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever.  \"He had married,\" he said, \"for love, and for love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love.\"  When I thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses?  What else could I think?  HE, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful!  To be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of HIM--particularly so in his absence--when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her \"beloved husband, Mr. Wyatt.\"  The word \"husband\" seemed forever--to use one of her own delicate expressions--forever \"on the tip of her tongue.\"  In the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided HER in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main cabin."," My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist, by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued.  I pitied him from the bottom of my heart--but could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the \"Last Supper.\" For this I resolved to have my revenge."," One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward.  His gloom, however (which I considered quite natural under the circumstances), seemed entirely unabated.  He said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort.  I ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile.  Poor fellow!--as I thought of HIS WIFE, I wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth.  At last I ventured a home thrust.  I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box--just to let him perceive, gradually, that I was NOT altogether the butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My first observation was by way of opening a masked battery.  I said something about the \"peculiar shape of THAT box--,\"and, as I spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs."," The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced me, at once, that he was mad.  At first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets.  Then he grew very red--then hideously pale--then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more.  In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck.  When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was DEAD."," I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself.  Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time.  At length we bled him and put him to bed.  The next morning he was quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health.  Of his mind I say nothing, of course.  I avoided him during the rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board."," Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed.  Among other things, this: I had been nervous-- drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night--in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at all.  Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board.  Wyatt's three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night.  As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it.  But my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question (and my own door was ALWAYS open on account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights (NOT consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about eleven o'clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back.  That they were virtually separated was clear.  They had separate apartments--no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the extra stateroom."," There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much. During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra stateroom, I was attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband.  After listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import.  They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet--the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped."," In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid--also, that I could determine when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down VERY gently--there being no room for it on the floor.  After this there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible--if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination.  I say it seemed to RESEMBLE sobbing or sighing--but, of course, it could not have been either.  I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears.  Mr. Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies--indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm.  He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within.  There was nothing in this, however, to make him SOB.  I repeat, therefore, that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain Hardy's green tea.  just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet.  Having done this, he issued from his state- room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from hers."," We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras, when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest.  We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time.  Every thing was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed."," In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours--the ship proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and shipping no water of any consequence.  At the end of this period, however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after-- sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately after the other.  By this accident we lost three men overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm staysail and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before."," The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating.  The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by the board.  For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold.  To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless."," All was now confusion and despair--but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that remained. This we at last accomplished--but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak gained on us very fast."," At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats.  At eight P. M., the clouds broke away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon--a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits."," After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the longboat over the side without material accident, and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers.  This party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering, finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day after the wreck."," Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board, resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern.  We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water.  It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr. Wyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and myself, with a negro valet."," We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our backs.  No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more.  What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box!"," \"Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,\" replied the captain, somewhat sternly, \"you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still.  Our gunwhale is almost in the water now.\""," \"The box!\" vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing--\"the box, I say! Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me.  Its weight will be but a trifle--it is nothing--mere nothing.  By the mother who bore you--for the love of Heaven--by your hope of salvation, I implore you to put back for the box!\""," The captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely said:"," \"Mr. Wyatt, you are mad.  I cannot listen to you.  Sit down, I say, or you will swamp the boat.  Stay--hold him--seize him!--he is about to spring overboard! There--I knew it--he is over!\""," As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore-chains.  In another moment he was on board, and rushing frantically down into the cabin."," In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running.  We made a determined effort to put back, but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest. We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed."," As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the companion--way, up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box.  While we gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his body. In another instant both body and box were in the sea--disappearing suddenly, at once and forever."," We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted upon the spot.  At length we pulled away.  The silence remained unbroken for an hour.  Finally, I hazarded a remark."," \"Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank?  Was not that an exceedingly singular thing?  I confess that I entertained some feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself to the box, and commit himself to the sea.\""," \"They sank as a matter of course,\" replied the captain, \"and that like a shot.  They will soon rise again, however--BUT NOT TILL THE SALT MELTS.\""," \"The salt!\" I ejaculated."," \"Hush!\" said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased.  \"We must talk of these things at some more appropriate time.\"",""," We suffered much, and made a narrow escape, but fortune befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat.  We landed, in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island.  We remained here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length obtained a passage to New York."," About a month after the loss of the \"Independence,\" I happened to meet Captain Hardy in Broadway.  Our conversation turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor Wyatt.  I thus learned the following particulars."," The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and a servant.  His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely, and most accomplished woman.  On the morning of the fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship), the lady suddenly sickened and died.  The young husband was frantic with grief--but circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to New York.  It was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body."," In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise.  Nothing was to be said of the lady's decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage.  This the deceased lady's-maid was easily prevailed on to do.  The extra state-room, originally engaged for this girl during her mistress' life, was now merely retained.  In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept, of course, every night.  In the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress--whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers on board."," My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament.  But of late, it is a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night.  There is a countenance which haunts me, turn as I will.  There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears."],"excerpt":"Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S.

All of them, kidding him the whole rest of the day."," He came to the corner and stopped for the light. On the other side of the street rose the big white concrete building, the towering column of steel and cement, girders and glass windows--the office building. Ed flinched. Maybe he could say the elevator got stuck. Somewhere between the second and third floor."," The street light changed. Nobody else was crossing. Ed crossed alone. He hopped up on the curb on the far side--"," And stopped, rigid."," The sun had winked off. One moment it was beaming down. Then it was gone. Ed looked sharply up. Gray clouds swirled above him. Huge, formless clouds. Nothing more. An ominous, thick haze that made everything waver and dim. Uneasy chills plucked at him. What was it?"," He advanced cautiously, feeling his way through the mist. Everything was silent. No sounds--not even the traffic sounds. Ed peered frantically around, trying to see through the rolling haze. No people. No cars. No sun. Nothing."," The office building loomed up ahead, ghostly. It was an indistinct gray. He put out his hand uncertainly--"," A section of the building fell away. It rained down, a torrent of particles. Like sand. Ed gaped foolishly. A cascade of gray debris, spilling around his feet. And where he had touched the building, a jagged cavity yawned--an ugly pit marring the concrete."," Dazed, he made his way to the front steps. He mounted them. The steps gave way underfoot. His feet sank down. He was wading through shifting sand, weak, rotted stuff that broke under his weight."," He got into the lobby. The lobby was dim and obscure. The overhead lights flickered feebly in the gloom. An unearthly pall hung over everything."," He spied the cigar stand. The seller leaned silently, resting on the counter, toothpick between his teeth, his face vacant. And gray. He was gray all over."," \"Hey,\" Ed croaked. \"What's going on?\""," The seller did not answer. Ed reached out toward him. His hand touched the seller's gray arm--and passed right through."," \"Good God,\" Ed said."," The seller's arm came loose. It fell to the lobby floor, disintegrating into fragments. Bits of gray fiber. Like dust. Ed's senses reeled."," \"Help!\" he shouted, finding his voice."," No answer. He peered around. A few shapes stood here and there: a man reading a newspaper, two women waiting at the elevator."," Ed made his way over to the man. He reached out and touched him."," The man slowly collapsed. He settled into a heap, a loose pile of gray ash. Dust. Particles. The two women dissolved when he touched them. Silently. They made no sound as they broke apart."," Ed found the stairs. He grabbed hold of the bannister and climbed. The stairs collapsed under him. He hurried faster. Behind him lay a broken path--his footprints clearly visible in the concrete. Clouds of ash blew around him as he reached the second floor."," He gazed down the silent corridor. He saw more clouds of ash. He heard no sound. There was just darkness--rolling darkness."," He climbed unsteadily to the third floor. Once, his shoe broke completely through the stair. For a sickening second he hung, poised over a yawning hole that looked down into a bottomless nothing."," Then he climbed on, and emerged in front of his own office: DOUGLAS AND BLAKE, REAL ESTATE."," The hall was dim, gloomy with clouds of ash. The overhead lights flickered fitfully. He reached for the door handle. The handle came off in his hand. He dropped it and dug his fingernails into the door. The plate glass crashed past him, breaking into bits. He tore the door open and stepped over it, into the office."," Miss Evans sat at her typewriter, fingers resting quietly on the keys. She did not move. She was gray, her hair, her skin, her clothing. She was without color. Ed touched her. His fingers went through her shoulder, into dry flakiness."," He drew back, sickened. Miss Evans did not stir."," He moved on. He pushed against a desk. The desk collapsed into rotting dust. Earl Hendricks stood by the water cooler, a cup in his hand. He was a gray statue, unmoving. Nothing stirred. No sound. No life. The whole office was gray dust--without life or motion."," Ed found himself out in the corridor again. He shook his head, dazed. What did it mean? Was he going out of his mind? Was he--?"," A sound."," Ed turned, peering into the gray mist. A creature was coming, hurrying rapidly. A man--a man in a white robe. Behind him others came. Men in white, with equipment. They were lugging complex machinery."," \"Hey--\" Ed gasped weakly."," The men stopped. Their mouths opened. Their eyes popped."," \"Look!\""," \"Something's gone wrong!\""," \"One still charged.\""," \"Get the de-energizer.\""," \"We can't proceed until--\""," The men came toward Ed, moving around him. One lugged a long hose with some sort of nozzle. A portable cart came wheeling up. Instructions were rapidly shouted."," Ed broke out of his paralysis. Fear swept over him. Panic. Something hideous was happening. He had to get out. Warn people. Get away."," He turned and ran, back down the stairs. The stairs collapsed under him. He fell half a flight, rolling in heaps of dry ash. He got to his feet and hurried on, down to the ground floor."," The lobby was lost in the clouds of gray ash. He pushed blindly through, toward the door. Behind him, the white-clad men were coming, dragging their equipment and shouting to each other, hurrying quickly after him."," He reached the sidewalk. Behind him the office building wavered and sagged, sinking to one side, torrents of ash raining down in heaps. He raced toward the corner, the men just behind him. Gray clouds swirled around him. He groped his way across the street, hands outstretched. He gained the opposite curb--"," The sun winked on. Warm yellow sunlight streamed down on him. Cars honked. Traffic lights changed. On all sides men and women in bright spring clothes hurried and pushed: shoppers, a blue-clad cop, salesmen with briefcases. Stores, windows, signs ... noisy cars moving up and down the street ..."," And overhead was the bright sun and familiar blue sky."," Ed halted, gasping for breath. He turned and looked back the way he had come. Across the street was the office building--as it had always been. Firm and distinct. Concrete and glass and steel."," He stepped back a pace and collided with a hurrying citizen. \"Hey,\" the man grunted. \"Watch it.\""," \"Sorry.\" Ed shook his head, trying to clear it. From where he stood, the office building looked like always, big and solemn and substantial, rising up imposingly on the other side of the street."," But a minute ago--"," Maybe he was out of his mind. He had seen the building crumbling into dust. Building--and people. They had fallen into gray clouds of dust. And the men in white--they had chased him. Men in white robes, shouting orders, wheeling complex equipment."," He was out of his mind. There was no other explanation. Weakly, Ed turned and stumbled along the sidewalk, his mind reeling. He moved blindly, without purpose, lost in a haze of confusion and terror.","",""," He paced back and forth nervously, clasping and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension. He took off his glasses and wiped them shakily."," Lord. All the trouble and grief. And it wasn't his fault. But he would have to take the rap. It was his responsibility to get the Summoners routed out and their instructions followed. The miserable flea-infested Summoner had gone back to sleep--and he would have to answer for it."," The doors opened. \"All right,\" a voice murmured, preoccupied. It was a tired, care-worn voice. The Clerk trembled and entered slowly, sweat dripping down his neck into his celluloid collar."," The Old Man glanced up, laying aside his book. He studied the Clerk calmly, his faded blue eyes mild--a deep, ancient mildness that made the Clerk tremble even more. He took out his handkerchief and mopped his brow."," \"I understand there was a mistake,\" the Old Man murmured. \"In connection with Sector T137. Something to do with an element from an adjoining area.\""," \"That's right.\" The Clerk's voice was faint and husky. \"Very unfortunate.\""," \"What exactly occurred?\""," \"I started out this morning with my instruction sheets. The material relating to T137 had top priority, of course. I served notice on the Summoner in my area that an eight-fifteen summons was required.\""," \"Did the Summoner understand the urgency?\""," \"Yes, sir.\" The Clerk hesitated. \"But--\""," \"But what?\""," The Clerk twisted miserably. \"While my back was turned the Summoner crawled back in his shed and went to sleep. I was occupied, checking the exact time with my watch. I called the moment--but there was no response.\""," \"You called at eight-fifteen exactly?\""," \"Yes, sir! Exactly eight-fifteen. But the Summoner was asleep. By the time I managed to arouse him it was eight-sixteen. He summoned, but instead of A Friend with a Car we got a--A Life Insurance Salesman.\" The Clerk's face screwed up with disgust. \"The Salesman kept the element there until almost nine-thirty. Therefore he was late to work instead of early.\""," For a moment the Old Man was silent. \"Then the element was not within T137 when the adjustment began.\""," \"No. He arrived about ten o'clock.\""," \"During the middle of the adjustment.\" The Old Man got to his feet and paced slowly back and forth, face grim, hands behind his back. His long robe flowed out behind him. \"A serious matter. During a Sector Adjustment all related elements from other Sectors must be included. Otherwise, their orientations remain out of phase. When this element entered T137 the adjustment had been in progress fifty minutes. The element encountered the Sector at its most de-energized stage. He wandered about until one of the adjustment teams met him.\""," \"Did they catch him?\""," \"Unfortunately no. He fled, out of the Sector. Into a nearby fully energized area.\""," \"What--what then?\"","",""," The Old Man stopped pacing, his lined face grim. He ran a heavy hand through his long white hair. \"We do not know. We lost contact with him. We will reestablish contact soon, of course. But for the moment he is out of control.\""," \"What are you going to do?\""," \"He must be contacted and contained. He must be brought up here. There's no other solution.\""," \"Up here!\""," \"It is too late to de-energize him. By the time he is regained he will have told others. To wipe his mind clean would only complicate matters. Usual methods will not suffice. I must deal with this problem myself.\""," \"I hope he's located quickly,\" the Clerk said."," \"He will be. Every Watcher is alerted. Every Watcher and every Summoner.\" The Old Man's eyes twinkled. \"Even the Clerks, although we hesitate to count on them.\""," The Clerk flushed. \"I'll be glad when this thing is over,\" he muttered.","",""," \"Ruth.\" Ed stepped up behind her."," \"Ed!\" She spun, gasping in astonishment. \"What are you doing away from--?\""," \"Come on.\" Ed grabbed her arm, pulling her along. \"Let's keep moving.\""," \"But what--?\""," \"I'll tell you later.\" Ed's face was pale and grim. \"Let's go where we can talk. In private.\""," \"I was going down to have lunch at Louie's. We can talk there.\" Ruth hurried along breathlessly. \"What is it? What's happened? You look so strange. And why aren't you at work? Did you--did you get fired?\""," They crossed the street and entered a small restaurant. Men and women milled around, getting their lunch. Ed found a table in the back, secluded in a corner. \"Here.\" He sat down abruptly. \"This will do.\" She slid into the other chair."," Ed ordered a cup of coffee. Ruth had salad and creamed tuna on toast, coffee and peach pie. Silently, Ed watched her as she ate, his face dark and moody."," \"Please tell me,\" Ruth begged."," \"You really want to know?\""," \"Of course I want to know!\" Ruth put her small hand anxiously on his. \"I'm your wife.\""," \"Something happened today. This morning. I was late to work. A damn insurance man came by and held me up. I was half an hour late.\""," Ruth caught her breath. \"Douglas fired you.\""," \"No.\" Ed ripped a paper napkin slowly into bits. He stuffed the bits in the half-empty water glass. \"I was worried as hell. I got off the bus and hurried down the street. I noticed it when I stepped up on the curb in front of the office.\""," \"Noticed what?\""," Ed told her. The whole works. Everything."," When he had finished, Ruth sat back, her face white, hands trembling. \"I see,\" she murmured. \"No wonder you're upset.\" She drank a little cold coffee, the cup rattling against the saucer. \"What a terrible thing.\""," Ed leaned intently toward his wife. \"Ruth. Do you think I'm going crazy?\""," Ruth's red lips twisted. \"I don't know what to say. It's so strange...\""," \"Yeah. Strange is hardly the word for it. I poked my hands right through them. Like they were clay. Old dry clay. Dust. Dust figures.\" Ed lit a cigarette from Ruth's pack. \"When I got out I looked back and there it was. The office building. Like always.\""," \"You were afraid Mr. Douglas would bawl you out, weren't you?\""," \"Sure. I was afraid--and guilty.\" Ed's eyes flickered. \"I know what you're thinking. I was late and I couldn't face him. So I had some sort of protective psychotic fit. Retreat from reality.\" He stubbed the cigarette out savagely. \"Ruth, I've been wandering around town since. Two and a half hours. Sure, I'm afraid. I'm afraid like hell to go back.\""," \"Of Douglas?\""," \"No! The men in white.\" Ed shuddered. \"God. Chasing me. With their damn hoses and--and equipment.\""," Ruth was silent. Finally she looked up at her husband, her dark eyes bright. \"You have to go back, Ed.\""," \"Back? Why?\""," \"To prove something.\""," \"Prove what?\""," \"Prove it's all right.\" Ruth's hand pressed against his. \"You have to, Ed. You have to go back and face it. To show yourself there's nothing to be afraid of.\""," \"The hell with it! After what I saw? Listen, Ruth. I saw the fabric of reality split open. I saw--behind. Underneath. I saw what was really there. And I don't want to go back. I don't want to see dust people again. Ever.\""," Ruth's eyes were fixed intently on him. \"I'll go back with you,\" she said."," \"For God's sake.\""," \"For your sake. For your sanity. So you'll know.\" Ruth got abruptly to her feet, pulling her coat around her. \"Come on, Ed. I'll go with you. We'll go up there together. To the office of Douglas and Blake, Real Estate. I'll even go in with you to see Mr. Douglas.\""," Ed got up slowly, staring hard at his wife. \"You think I blacked out. Cold feet. Couldn't face the boss.\" His voice was low and strained. \"Don't you?\""," Ruth was already threading her way toward the cashier. \"Come on. You'll see. It'll all be there. Just like it always was.\""," \"Okay,\" Ed said. He followed her slowly. \"We'll go back there--and see which of us is right.\"","",""," \"There it is,\" Ruth said. \"See?\""," There it was, all right. The big building rose up, firm and solid, glittering in the early afternoon sun, its windows sparkling brightly."," Ed and Ruth stepped up onto the curb. Ed tensed himself, his body rigid. He winced as his foot touched the pavement--"," But nothing happened: the street noises continued; cars, people hurrying past; a kid selling papers. There were sounds, smells, the noises of the city in the middle of the day. And overhead was the sun and the bright blue sky."," \"See?\" Ruth said. \"I was right.\""," They walked up the front steps, into the lobby. Behind the cigar stand the seller stood, arms folded, listening to the ball game. \"Hi, Mr. Fletcher,\" he called to Ed. His face lit up good-naturedly. \"Who's the dame? Your wife know about this?\""," Ed laughed unsteadily. They passed on toward the elevator. Four or five businessmen stood waiting. They were middle-aged men, well dressed, waiting impatiently in a bunch. \"Hey, Fletcher,\" one said. \"Where you been all day? Douglas is yelling his head off.\""," \"Hello, Earl,\" Ed muttered. He gripped Ruth's arm. \"Been a little sick.\""," The elevator came. They got in. The elevator rose. \"Hi, Ed,\" the elevator operator said. \"Who's the good-looking gal? Why don't you introduce her around?\""," Ed grinned mechanically. \"My wife.\""," The elevator let them off at the third floor. Ed and Ruth got out, heading toward the glass door of Douglas and Blake, Real Estate."," Ed halted, breathing shallowly. \"Wait.\" He licked his lips. \"I--\""," Ruth waited calmly as Ed wiped his forehead and neck with his handkerchief. \"All right now?\""," \"Yeah.\" Ed moved forward. He pulled open the glass door."," Miss Evans glanced up, ceasing her typing. \"Ed Fletcher! Where on earth have you been?\""," \"I've been sick. Hello, Tom.\""," Tom glanced up from his work. \"Hi, Ed. Say, Douglas is yelling for your scalp. Where have you been?\""," \"I know.\" Ed turned wearily to Ruth. \"I guess I better go in and face the music.\""," Ruth squeezed his arm. \"You'll be all right. I know.\" She smiled, a relieved flash of white teeth and red lips. \"Okay? Call me if you need me.\""," \"Sure.\" Ed kissed her briefly on the mouth. \"Thanks, honey. Thanks a lot. I don't know what the hell went wrong with me. I guess it's over.\""," \"Forget it. So long.\" Ruth skipped back out of the office, the door closing after her. Ed listened to her race down the hall to the elevator."," \"Nice little gal,\" Jackie said appreciatively."," \"Yeah.\" Ed nodded, straightening his necktie. He moved unhappily toward the inner office, steeling himself. Well, he had to face it. Ruth was right. But he was going to have a hell of a time explaining it to the boss. He could see Douglas now, thick red wattles, big bull roar, face distorted with rage--"," Ed stopped abruptly at the entrance to the inner office. He froze rigid. The inner office--it was changed.","",""," Changes. Little changes. Subtle. Ed closed his eyes and opened them slowly. He was alert, breathing rapidly, his pulse racing. It was changed, all right. No doubt about it."," \"What's the matter, Ed?\" Tom asked. The staff watched him curiously, pausing in their work."," Ed said nothing. He advanced slowly into the inner office. The office had been gone over. He could tell. Things had been altered. Rearranged. Nothing obvious--nothing he could put his finger on. But he could tell."," Joe Kent greeted him uneasily. \"What's the matter, Ed? You look like a wild dog. Is something--?\""," Ed studied Joe. He was different. Not the same. What was it?"," Joe's face. It was a little fuller. His shirt was blue-striped. Joe never wore blue stripes. Ed examined Joe's desk. He saw papers and accounts. The desk--it was too far to the right. And it was bigger. It wasn't the same desk."," The picture on the wall. It wasn't the same. It was a different picture entirely. And the things on top of the file cabinet--some were new, others were gone."," He looked back through the door. Now that he thought about it, Miss Evans' hair was different, done a different way. And it was lighter."," In here, Mary, filing her nails, over by the window--she was taller, fuller. Her purse, lying on the desk in front of her--a red purse, red knit."," \"You always...have that purse?\" Ed demanded."," Mary glanced up. \"What?\""," \"That purse. You always have that?\""," Mary laughed. She smoothed her skirt coyly around her shapely thighs, her long lashes blinking modestly. \"Why, Mr. Fletcher. What do you mean?\""," Ed turned away. He knew. Even if she didn't. She had been redone--changed: her purse, her clothes, her figure, everything about her. None of them knew--but him. His mind spun dizzily. They were all changed. All of them were different. They had all been remolded, recast. Subtly--but it was there."," The wastebasket. It was smaller, not the same. The window shades--white, not ivory. The wall paper was not the same pattern. The lighting fixtures..."," Endless, subtle changes."," Ed made his way back to the inner office. He lifted his hand and knocked on Douglas' door."," \"Come in.\""," Ed pushed the door open. Nathan Douglas looked up impatiently. \"Mr. Douglas--\" Ed began. He came into the room unsteadily--and stopped."," Douglas was not the same. Not at all. His whole office was changed: the rugs, the drapes. The desk was oak, not mahogany. And Douglas himself..."," Douglas was younger, thinner. His hair, brown. His skin not so red. His face smoother. No wrinkles. Chin reshaped. Eyes green, not black. He was a different man. But still Douglas--a different Douglas. A different version!"," \"What is it?\" Douglas demanded impatiently. \"Oh, it's you, Fletcher. Where were you this morning?\""," Ed backed out. Fast."," He slammed the door and hurried back through the inner office. Tom and Miss Evans glanced up, startled. Ed passed by them, grabbing the hall door open."," \"Hey!\" Tom called. \"What--?\""," Ed hurried down the hall. Terror leaped through him. He had to hurry. He had seen. There wasn't much time. He came to the elevator and stabbed the button."," No time."," He ran to the stairs and started down. He reached the second floor. His terror grew. It was a matter of seconds."," Seconds!"," The public phone. Ed ran into the phone booth. He dragged the door shut after him. Wildly, he dropped a dime in the slot and dialed. He had to call the police. He held the receiver to his ear, his heart pounding."," Warn them. Changes. Somebody tampering with reality. Altering it. He had been right. The white-clad men...their equipment...going through the building."," \"Hello!\" Ed shouted hoarsely. There was no answer. No hum. Nothing."," Ed peered frantically out the door."," And he sagged, defeated. Slowly, he hung up the telephone receiver."," He was no longer on the second floor. The phone booth was rising, leaving the second floor behind, carrying him up, faster and faster. It rose floor by floor, moving silently, swiftly."," The phone booth passed through the ceiling of the building and out into the bright sunlight. It gained speed. The ground fell away below. Buildings and streets were getting smaller each moment. Tiny specks hurried along, far below, cars and people, dwindling rapidly."," Clouds drifted between him and the earth. Ed shut his eyes, dizzy with fright. He held on desperately to the door handles of the phone booth."," Faster and faster the phone booth climbed. The earth was rapidly being left behind, far below."," Ed peered up wildly. Where? Where was he going? Where was it taking him?"," He stood gripping the door handles, waiting.","",""," Ed Fletcher looked around him. He was in a huge chamber. The edges fell away into indistinct shadows. In front of him stood a man with notes and ledgers under his arm, peering at him through steel-rimmed glasses. He was a nervous little man, sharp-eyed, with celluloid collar, blue-serge suit, vest, watch chain. He wore black shiny shoes."," And beyond him--"," An old man sat quietly, in an immense modern chair. He watched Fletcher calmly, his blue eyes mild and tired. A strange thrill shot through Fletcher. It was not fear. Rather it was a vibration, rattling his bones--a deep sense of awe, tinged with fascination."," \"Where--what is this place?\" he asked faintly. He was still dazed from his quick ascent."," \"Don't ask questions!\" the nervous little man snapped angrily, tapping his pencil against his ledgers. \"You're here to answer, not ask.\""," The Old Man moved a little. He raised his hand. \"I will speak to the element alone,\" he murmured. His voice was low. It vibrated and rumbled through the chamber. Again the wave of fascinated awe swept Ed."," \"Alone?\" The little fellow backed away, gathering his books and papers in his arms. \"Of course.\" He glanced hostilely at Ed Fletcher. \"I'm glad he's finally in custody. All the work and trouble just for--\""," He disappeared through a door. The door closed softly behind him. Ed and the Old Man were alone."," \"Please sit down,\" the Old Man said."," Ed found a seat. He sat down awkwardly, nervously. He got out his cigarettes and then put them away again."," \"What's wrong?\" the Old Man asked."," \"I'm just beginning to understand.\""," \"Understand what?\""," \"That I'm dead.\""," The Old Man smiled briefly. \"Dead? No, you're not dead. You're...visiting. An unusual event, but necessitated by circumstances.\" He leaned toward Ed. \"Mr. Fletcher, you have got yourself involved in something.\""," \"Yeah,\" Ed agreed. \"I wish I knew what it was. Or how it happened.\""," \"It was not your fault. You're the victim of a clerical error. A mistake was made--not by you. But involving you.\""," \"What mistake?\" Ed rubbed his forehead wearily. \"I--I got in on something. I saw through. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see.\""," The Old Man nodded. \"That's right. You saw something you were not supposed to see--something few elements have been aware of, let alone witnessed.\""," \"Elements?\""," \"An official term. Let it pass. A mistake was made, but we hope to rectify it. It is my hope that--\""," \"Those people,\" Ed interrupted. \"Heaps of dry ash. And gray. Like they were dead. Only it was everything: the stairs and walls and floor. No color or life.\""," \"That Sector had been temporarily de-energized. So the adjustment team could enter and effect changes.\""," \"Changes.\" Ed nodded. \"That's right. When I went back later, everything was alive again. But not the same. It was all different.\""," \"The adjustment was complete by noon. The team finished its work and re-energized the Sector.\""," \"I see,\" Ed muttered."," \"You were supposed to have been in the Sector when the adjustment began. Because of an error you were not. You came into the Sector late--during the adjustment itself. You fled, and when you returned it was over. You saw, and you should not have seen. Instead of a witness you should have been part of the adjustment. Like the others, you should have undergone changes.\""," Sweat came out on Ed Fletcher's head. He wiped it away. His stomach turned over. Weakly, he cleared his throat. \"I get the picture.\" His voice was almost inaudible. A chilling premonition moved through him. \"I was supposed to be changed like the others. But I guess something went wrong.\""," \"Something went wrong. An error occurred. And now a serious problem exists. You have seen these things. You know a great deal. And you are not coordinated with the new configuration.\""," \"Gosh,\" Ed muttered. \"Well, I won't tell anybody.\" Cold sweat poured off him. \"You can count on that. I'm as good as changed.\""," \"You have already told someone,\" the Old Man said coldly."," \"Me?\" Ed blinked. \"Who?\""," \"Your wife.\""," Ed trembled. The color drained from his face, leaving it sickly white. \"That's right. I did.\""," \"Your wife knows.\" The Old Man's face twisted angrily. \"A woman. Of all the things to tell--\""," \"I didn't know.\" Ed retreated, panic leaping through him. \"But I know now. You can count on me. Consider me changed.\""," The ancient blue eyes bored keenly into him, peering far into his depths. \"And you were going to call the police. You wanted to inform the authorities.\""," \"But I didn't know who was doing the changing.\""," \"Now you know. The natural process must be supplemented--adjusted here and there. Corrections must be made. We are fully licensed to make such corrections. Our adjustment teams perform vital work.\""," Ed plucked up a measure of courage. \"This particular adjustment. Douglas. The office. What was it for? I'm sure it was some worthwhile purpose.\""," The Old Man waved his hand. Behind him in the shadows an immense map glowed into existence. Ed caught his breath. The edges of the map faded off in obscurity. He saw an infinite web of detailed sections, a network of squares and ruled lines. Each square was marked. Some glowed with a blue light. The lights altered constantly."," \"The Sector Board,\" the Old Man said. He sighed wearily. \"A staggering job. Sometimes we wonder how we can go on another period. But it must be done. For the good of all. For your good.\""," \"The change. In our--our Sector.\""," \"Your office deals in real estate. The old Douglas was a shrewd man, but rapidly becoming infirm. His physical health was waning. In a few days Douglas will be offered a chance to purchase a large unimproved forest area in western Canada. It will require most of his assets. The older, less virile Douglas would have hesitated. It is imperative he not hesitate. He must purchase the area and clear the land at once. Only a younger man--a younger Douglas--would undertake this."," \"When the land is cleared, certain anthropological remains will be discovered. They have already been placed there. Douglas will lease his land to the Canadian Government for scientific study. The remains found there will cause international excitement in learned circles."," \"A chain of events will be set in motion. Men from numerous countries will come to Canada to examine the remains. Soviet, Polish, and Czech scientists will make the journey."," \"The chain of events will draw these scientists together for the first time in years. National research will be temporarily forgotten in the excitement of these non-national discoveries. One of the leading Soviet scientists will make friends with a Belgian scientist. Before they depart they will agree to correspond--without the knowledge of their governments, of course."," \"The circle will widen. Other scientists on both sides will be drawn in. A society will be founded. More and more educated men will transfer an increasing amount of time to this international society. Purely national research will suffer a slight but extremely critical eclipse. The war tension will somewhat wane."," \"This alteration is vital. And it is dependent on the purchase and clearing of the section of wilderness in Canada. The old Douglas would not have dared take the risk. But the altered Douglas, and his altered, more youthful staff, will pursue this work with wholehearted enthusiasm. And from this, the vital chain of widening events will come about. The beneficiaries will be you. Our methods may seem strange and indirect. Even incomprehensible. But I assure you we know what we're doing.\""," \"I know that now,\" Ed said."," \"So you do. You know a great deal. Much too much. No element should possess such knowledge. I should perhaps call an adjustment team in here...\""," A picture formed in Ed's mind: swirling gray clouds, gray men and women. He shuddered. \"Look,\" he croaked. \"I'll do anything. Anything at all. Only don't de-energize me.\" Sweat ran down his face. \"Okay?\""," The Old Man pondered. \"Perhaps some alternative could be found. There is another possibility...\""," \"What?\" Ed asked eagerly. \"What is it?\""," The Old Man spoke slowly, thoughtfully. \"If I allow you to return, you will swear never to speak of the matter? Will you swear not to reveal to anyone the things you saw? The things you know?\""," \"Sure!\" Ed gasped eagerly, blinding relief flooding over him. \"I swear!\""," \"Your wife. She must know nothing more. She must think it was only a passing psychological fit--retreat from reality.\""," \"She thinks that already.\""," \"She must continue to.\""," Ed set his jaw firmly. \"I'll see that she continues to think it was a mental aberration. She'll never know what really happened.\""," \"You are certain you can keep the truth from her?\""," \"Sure,\" Ed said confidently. \"I know I can.\""," \"All right.\" The Old Man nodded slowly. \"I will send you back. But you must tell no one.\" He swelled visibly. \"Remember: you will eventually come back to me--everyone does, in the end--and your fate will not be enviable.\""," \"I won't tell her,\" Ed said, sweating. \"I promise. You have my word on that. I can handle Ruth. Don't give it a second thought.\"","",""," He blinked, dazed from the rapid descent.

Where else--?\""," \"I called Douglas about three. He said you left. You walked out, practically as soon as I turned my back. Eddie--\""," Ed patted her nervously. \"Take it easy, honey.\" He began unbuttoning his coat. \"Everything's okay. Understand?

She got down from the arm of the couch. \"I'll change and fix dinner.\""," She hurried into the bedroom and slipped off her shoes and nylons. Ed followed her. \"I didn't mean to worry you,\" he said carefully. \"After you left me today I realized you were right.\""," \"Oh?\" Ruth unfastened her blouse and skirt, arranging them over a hanger. \"Right about what?\""," \"About me.\" He manufactured a grin and made it glow across his face. \"About...what happened.\""," Ruth hung her slip over the hanger. She studied her husband intently as she struggled into her tight-fitting jeans. \"Go on.\""," The moment had come. It was now or never. Ed Fletcher braced himself and chose his words carefully. \"I realized,\" he stated, \"that the whole darn thing was in my mind. You were right, Ruth. Completely right.

I haven't had a vacation in years. My mind isn't on my job. I've been daydreaming.\" He said it firmly, but his heart was in his mouth. \"I need to get away. To the mountains. Bass fishing. Or--\" He searched his mind frantically. \"Or--\""," Ruth came toward him ominously. \"Ed!\" she said sharply. \"Look at me!\""," \"What's the matter?\" Panic shot through him. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\""," \"Where were you this afternoon?\""," Ed's grin faded. \"I told you. I went for a walk. Didn't I tell you? A walk. To think things over.\""," \"Don't lie to me, Eddie Fletcher! I can tell when you're lying!\" Fresh tears welled up in Ruth's eyes. Her breasts rose and fell excitedly under her cotton shirt. \"Admit it! You didn't go for a walk!\""," Ed stammered weakly. Sweat poured off him. He sagged helplessly against the door. \"What do you mean?\""," Ruth's black eyes flashed with anger. \"Come on! I want to know where you were! Tell me! I have a right to know. What really happened?\""," Ed retreated in terror, his resolve melting like wax. It was going all wrong. \"Honest. I went out for a--\""," \"Tell me!\" Ruth's sharp fingernails dug into his arm. \"I want to know where you were--and who you were with!\""," Ed opened his mouth. He tried to grin, but his face failed to respond. \"I don't know what you mean.\""," \"You know what I mean. Who were you with? Where did you go? Tell me! I'll find out, sooner or later.\""," There was no way out. He was licked--and he knew it. He couldn't keep it from her. Desperately he stalled, praying for time. If he could only distract her, get her mind on something else. If she would only let up, even for a second. He could invent something--a better story. Time--he needed more time. \"Ruth, you've got to--\""," Suddenly there was a sound: the bark of a dog, echoing through the dark house."," Ruth let go, cocking her head alertly. \"That was Dobbie. I think somebody's coming.\""," The doorbell rang."," \"You stay here. I'll be right back.\" Ruth ran out of the room, to the front door. \"Darn it.\" She pulled the front door open."," \"Good evening!\" The young man stepped quickly inside, loaded down with objects, grinning broadly at Ruth. \"I'm from the Sweep-Rite Vacuum Cleaner Company.\""," Ruth scowled impatiently. \"Really, we're about to sit down at the table.\""," \"Oh, this will only take a moment.\" The young man set down the vacuum cleaner and its attachments with a metallic crash. Rapidly, he unrolled a long illustrated banner, showing the vacuum cleaner in action. \"Now, if you'll just hold this while I plug in the cleaner--\""," He bustled happily about, unplugging the TV set, plugging in the cleaner, pushing the chairs out of his way."," \"I'll show you the drape scraper first.\" He attached a hose and nozzle to the big gleaming tank. \"Now, if you'll just sit down I'll demonstrate each of these easy-to-use attachments.\" His happy voice rose over the roar of the cleaner. \"You'll notice--\"","",""," He gazed up, a look of gratitude on his face. \"Thanks,\" he said softly. \"I think we'll make it--after all.

I was curious to see your ship, learn about you. I suggested to the native--\""," The gun jerked."," \"See,\" Franco said. \"I thought so.\""," The wub settled down, panting. It put its paw out, pulling its tail around it."," \"It is very warm,\" the wub said. \"I understand that we are close to the jets. Atomic power.

I fell, walking home from school.\" She held up a slim arm. \"See the scar? I fell and cut myself on the gravel and slush. I came home crying -- it was sleeting and the wind was howling around me. My arm was bleeding and my mitten was soaked with blood. And then I looked up and saw them.\""," There was silence."," \"They want you,\" Everett said wretchedly. \"They're flies -- bluebottles, hovering around, waiting for you. Calling you to come along with them.\""," \"Why not?\" Silvia's gray eyes were shining and her cheeks radiated joy and anticipation. \"You've seen them, Daddy. You know what it means. Transfiguration -- from clay into gods!\""," Rick left the kitchen. In the living-room, the two sisters stood together, curious and uneasy. Mrs. Everett stood by herself, her face granite-hard, eyes bleak behind her steel-rimmed glasses. She turned away as Rick passed them."," \"What happened out there?\" Betty Lou asked him in a taut whisper. She was fifteen, skinny and plain, hollow cheeked, with mousy, sand-colored hair. \"Silvia never lets us come out with her.\""," \"Nothing happened,\" Rick answered."," Anger stirred the girl's barren face. \"That's not true. You were both out in the garden, in the dark, and --\""," \"Don't talk to him!\" her mother snapped. She yanked the two girls away and shot Rick a glare of hatred and misery. Then she turned quickly from him.","",""," Rick opened the door to the basement and switched on the light. He descended slowly into the cold, damp room of concrete and dirt, with its unwinking yellow light hanging from the dust-covered wires overhead."," In one corner loomed the big floor furnace with its mammoth hot air pipes. Beside it stood the water heater and discarded bundles, boxes of books, newspapers and old furniture, thick with dust, encrusted with strings of spider webs."," At the far end were the washing machine and spin dryer. And Silvia's pump and refrigeration system."," From the work bench Rick selected a hammer and two heavy pipe wrenches. He was moving towards the elaborate tanks and pipes when Silvia appeared abruptly at the top of the stairs, her coffee cup in one hand."," She hurried quickly down to him. \"What are you doing down here?\" she asked, studying him intently. \"Why that hammer and those two wrenches?\""," Rick dropped the tools back onto the bench. \"I thought maybe this could be solved on the spot.\""," Silvia moved between him and the tanks. \"I thought you understood. They've always been a part of my life. When I brought you with me the first time, you seemed to see what --\""," \"I don't want to lose you,\" Rick said harshly, \"to anybody or anything -- in this world or any other. I'm not going to give you up.\""," \"It's not giving me up!\" Her eyes narrowed. \"You came down here to destroy and break everything. The moment I'm not looking you'll smash all this, won't you?\""," \"That's right.\""," Fear replaced anger on the girl's face. \"Do you want me to be chained here? I have to go on -- I'm through with this part of the journey. I've stayed here long enough.\""," \"Can't you wait?\" Rick demanded furiously. He couldn't keep the ragged edge of despair out of his voice. \"Doesn't it come soon enough anyhow?\""," Silvia shrugged and turned away, her arms folded, her red lips tight together. \"You want to be a worm always. A fuzzy, little creeping caterpillar.\""," \"I want you.\""," \"You can't have me!\" She whirled angrily. \"I don't have any time to waste with this.\""," \"You have higher things in mind,\" Rick said savagely."," \"Of course.\" She softened a little. \"I'm sorry, Rick. Remember Icarus? You want to fly, too. I know it.\""," \"In my time.\""," \"Why not now? Why wait? You're afraid.\" She slid lithely away from him, cunning twisting her red lips. \"Rick, I want to show you something. Promise me first -- you won't tell anybody.\""," \"What is it?\""," \"Promise?\" She put her hand to his mouth. \"I have to be careful. It cost a lot of money. Nobody knows about it. It's what they do in China -- everything goes towards it.\""," \"I'm curious,\" Rick said. Uneasiness flicked at him. \"Show it to me.\""," Trembling with excitement, Silvia disappeared behind the huge lumbering refrigerator, back into the darkness behind the web of frost-hard freezing coils. He could hear her tugging and pulling at something. Scraping sounds, sounds of something large being dragged out."," \"See?\" Silvia gasped. \"Give me a hand, Rick. It's heavy. Hardwood and brass -- and metal lined. It's hand-stained and polished. And the carving -- see the carving! Isn't it beautiful?\""," \"What is it?\" Rick demanded huskily."," \"It's my cocoon,\" Silvia said simply. She settled down in a contented heap on the floor, and rested her head happily against the polished oak coffin."," Rick grabbed her by the arm and dragged her to her feet. \"You can't sit with that coffin, down here in the basement with --\" He broke off. \"What's the matter?\""," Silvia's face was twisting with pain. She backed away from him and put her finger quickly to her mouth. \"I cut myself -- when you pulled me up -- on a nail or something.\" A thin trickle of blood oozed down her fingers. She groped in her pocket for a handkerchief."," \"Let me see it.\" He moved towards her, but she avoided him. \"Is it bad?\" he demanded."," \"Stay away from me,\" Silvia whispered."," \"What's wrong? Let me see it!\""," \"Rick,\" Silvia said in a low intense voice, \"get some water and adhesive tape. As quickly as possible!\" She was trying to keep down her rising terror. \"I have to stop the bleeding.\""," \"Upstairs?\" He moved awkwardly away. \"It doesn't look too bad. Why don't you...\""," \"Hurry.\" The girl's voice was suddenly bleak with fear. \"Rick, hurry!\""," Confused, he ran a few steps."," Silvia's terror poured after him. \"No, it's too late,\" she called thinly. \"Don't come back -- keep away from me. It's my own fault. I trained them to come. Keep away! I'm sorry, Rick. Oh --\" Her voice was lost to him, as the wall of the basement burst and shattered. A cloud of luminous white forced its way through and blazed out into the basement."," It was Silvia they were after. She ran a few hesitant steps towards Rick, halted uncertainly, then the white mass of bodies and wings settled around her. She shrieked once. Then a violent explosion blasted the basement into a shimmering dance of furnace heat."," He was thrown to the floor. The cement was hot and dry -- the whole basement crackled with heat. Windows shattered as pulsing white shapes pushed out again. Smoke and flames licked up the walls. The ceiling sagged and rained plaster down."," Rick struggled to his feet. The furious activity was dying away. The basement was a littered chaos. All surfaces were scorched black, seared and crusted with smoking ash. Splintered wood, torn cloth and broken concrete were strewn everywhere. The furnace and washing machine were in ruins. The elaborate pumping and refrigeration system -- now were a glittering mass of slag. One whole wall had been twisted aside. Plaster was rubbled over everything."," Silvia was a twisted heap, arms and legs doubled grotesquely. Shriveled, carbonized remains of fire-scorched ash, settling in a vague mound. What had been left were charred fragments, a brittle burned-out husk.","",""," It was a dark night, cold and intense. A few stars glittered like ice from above his head. A faint, dank wind stirred through the dripping calla lilies and whipped gravel up in a frigid mist along the path between the black roses."," He crouched for a long time, listening and watching. Behind the cedars, the big house loomed against the sky. At the bottom of the slope a few cars slithered along the highway. Otherwise, there was no sound. Ahead of him jutted the squat outline of the porcelain trough and the pipe that had carried blood from the refrigerator in the basement. The trough was empty and dry, except for a few leaves that had fallen in it."," Rick took a deep breath of thin night air and held it. Then he got stiffly to his feet. He scanned the sky, but saw no movement. They were there, though, watching and waiting -- dim shadows, echoing into the legendary past, a line of god-figures."," He picked up the heavy gallon drums, dragged them to the trough and poured blood from a New Jersey abattoir, cheap-grade steer refuse, thick and clotted. It splashed against his clothes and he backed away nervously. But nothing stirred in the air above. The garden was silent, drenched with night fog and darkness."," He stood beside the trough, waiting and wondering if they were coming. They had come for Silvia, not merely for the blood. Without her there was no attraction but the raw food. He carried the empty metal cans over to the bushes and kicked them down the slope. He searched his pockets carefully, to make sure there was no metal in them."," Over the years, Silvia had nourished their habit of coming. Now she was on the other side. Did that mean they wouldn't come? Somewhere in the damp bushes something rustled. An animal or a bird?"," In the trough the blood glistened, heavy and dull, like old lead. It was their time to come, but nothing stirred the great trees above. He picked out the rows of nodding black roses, the gravel path down which he and Silvia had run -- violently he shut out the recent memory of her flashing eyes and deep red lips. The highway beyond the slope -- the empty, deserted garden -- the silent house in which her family huddled and waited. After a time, there was a dull, swishing sound. He tensed, but it was only a diesel truck lumbering along the highway, headlights blazing."," He stood grimly, his feet apart, his heels dug into the soft black ground. He wasn't leaving. He was staying there until they came. He wanted her back -- at any cost."," Overhead, foggy webs of moisture drifted across the moon. The sky was a vast barren plain, without life or warmth. The deathly cold of deep space, away from suns and living things. He gazed up until his neck ached. Cold stars, sliding in and out of the matted layer of fog. Was there anything else? Didn't they want to come, or weren't they interested in him? It had been Silvia who had interested them -- now they had her."," Behind him there was a movement without sound. He sensed it and started to turn, but suddenly, on all sides, the trees and undergrowth shifted. Like cardboard props they wavered and ran together, blending dully in the night shadows. Something moved through them, rapidly, silently, then was gone."," They had come. He could feel them. They had shut off their power and flame. Cold, indifferent statues, rising among the trees, dwarfing the cedars -- remote from him and his world, attracted by curiosity and mild habit."," \"Silvia,\" he said clearly. \"Which are you?\""," There was no response. Perhaps she wasn't among them. He felt foolish. A vague flicker of white drifted past the trough, hovered momentarily and then went on without stopping. The air above the trough vibrated, then died into immobility, as another giant inspected briefly and withdrew."," Panic breathed through him. They were leaving again, receding back into their own world. The trough had been rejected; they weren't interested."," \"Wait,\" he muttered thickly."," Some of the white shadows lingered. He approached them slowly, wary of their flickering immensity. If one of them touched him, he would sizzle briefly and puff into a dark heap of ash. A few feet away he halted."," \"You know what I want,\" he said. \"I want her back. She shouldn't have been taken yet.\""," Silence."," \"You were too greedy,\" he said. \"You did the wrong thing. She was going to come over to you, eventually. She had it all worked out.\""," The dark fog rustled. Among the trees the flickering shapes stirred and pulsed, responsive to his voice. \"True,\" came a detached impersonal sound. The sound drifted around him, from tree to tree, without location or direction. It was swept off by the night wind to die into dim echoes."," Relief settled over him. They had paused -- they were aware of him -- listening to what he had to say."," \"You think it's right?\" he demanded. \"She had a long life here. We were to marry, have children.\""," There was no answer, but he was conscious of a growing tension. He listened intently, but he couldn't make out anything. Presently he realized a struggle was taking place, a conflict among them. The tension grew -- more shapes flickered -- the clouds, the icy stars, were obscured by the vast presence swelling around him."," \"Rick!\" A voice spoke close by. Wavering, drifting back into the dim regions of the trees and dripping plants. He could hardly hear it -- the words were gone as soon as they were spoken. \"Rick -- help me get back.\""," \"Where are you?\" He couldn't locate her. \"What can I do?\""," \"I don't know.\" Her voice was wild with bewilderment and pain. \"I don't understand. Something went wrong. They must have thought I-wanted to come right away. I didn't!\""," \"I know,\" Rick said. \"It was an accident.\""," \"They were waiting. The cocoon, the trough -- but it was too soon.\" Her terror came across to him, from the vague distances of another universe. \"Rick, I've changed my mind. I want to come back.\""," \"It's not as simple as that.\""," \"I know. Rick, time is different on this side. I've been gone so long -- your world seems to creep along. It's been years, hasn't it?\""," \"One week,\" Rick said."," \"It was their fault. You don't blame me, do you? They know they did the wrong thing. Those who did it have been punished, but that doesn't help me.\" Misery and panic distorted her voice so he could hardly understand her. \"How can I come back?\""," \"Don't they know?\""," \"They say it can't be done.\" Her voice trembled. \"They say they destroyed the clay part -- it was incinerated. There's nothing for me to go back to.\""," Rick took a deep breath. \"Make them find some other way. It's up to them. Don't they have the power? They took you over too soon -- they must send you back. It's their responsibility.\""," The white shapes shifted uneasily. The conflict rose sharply; they couldn't agree. Rick warily moved back a few paces."," \"They say it's dangerous,\" Silvia's voice came from no particular spot. \"They say it was attempted once.\" She tried to control her voice. \"The nexus between this world and yours is unstable. There are vast amounts of free-floating energy. The power we -- on this side -- have isn't really our own. It's a universal energy, tapped and controlled.\""," \"Why can't they...\""," \"This is a higher continuum. There's a natural process of energy from lower to higher regions. But the reverse process is risky. The blood -- it's a sort of guide to follow -- a bright marker.\""," \"Like moths around a light bulb,\" Rick said bitterly."," \"If they send me back and something goes wrong --\" She broke off and then continued, \"If they make a mistake, I might be lost between the two regions. I might be absorbed by the free energy. It seems to be partly alive. It's not understood. Remember Prometheus and the fire...\""," \"I see,\" Rick said, as calmly as he could."," \"Darling, if they try to send me back, I'll have to find some shape to enter. You see, I don't exactly have a shape any more. There's no real material form on this side. What you see, the wings and the whiteness, are not really there. If I succeeded in making the trip back to your side...\""," \"You'd have to mold something,\" Rick said."," \"I'd have to take something there -- something of clay. I'd have to enter it and reshape it. As He did a long time ago, when the original form was put on your world.\""," \"If they did it once, they can do it again.\""," \"The One who did that is gone. He passed on upward.\" There was unhappy irony in her voice. \"There are regions beyond this. The ladder doesn't stop here. Nobody knows where it ends, it just seems to keep on going up and up. World after world.\""," \"Who decides about you?\" Rick demanded."," \"It's up to me,\" Silvia said faintly. \"They say, if I want to take the chance, they'll try it.\""," \"What do you think you'll do?\" he asked."," \"I'm afraid. What if something goes wrong? You haven't seen it, the region between. The possibilities there are incredible -- they terrify me. He was the only one with enough courage. Everyone else has been afraid.\""," \"It was their fault. They have to take responsibility.\""," \"They know that.\" Silvia hesitated miserably. \"Rick, darling, please tell me what to do.\""," \"Come back!\""," Silence. Then her voice, thin and pathetic. \"All right, Rick. If you think that's the right thing.\""," \"It is,\" he said firmly. He forced his mind not to think, not to picture or imagine anything. He had to have her back. \"Tell them to get started now. Tell them --\""," A deafening crack of heat burst in front of him. He was lifted up and tossed into a flaming sea of pure energy. They were leaving and the scalding lake of sheer power bellowed and thundered around him. For a split second he thought he glimpsed Silvia, her hands reaching imploringly towards him."," Then the fire cooled and he lay blinded in dripping, night-moistened darkness. Alone in the silence."," Walter Everett was helping him up. \"You damn fool!\" he was saying, again and again. \"You shouldn't have brought them back. They've got enough from us.\""," Then he was in the big, warm living room. Mrs. Everett stood silently in front of him, her face hard and expressionless. The two daughters hovered anxiously around him, fluttering and curious, eyes wide with morbid fascination."," \"I'll be all right,\" Rick muttered. His clothing was charred and blacked. He rubbed black ash from his face. Bits of dried grass stuck to his hair -- they had seared a circle around him as they'd ascended. He lay back against the couch and closed his eyes. When he opened them, Betty Lou Everett was forcing a glass of water into his hands."," \"Thanks,\" he muttered."," \"You should never have gone out there,\" Walter Everett repeated. \"Why? Why'd you do it? You know what happened to her. You want the same thing to happen to you?\""," \"I want her back,\" Rick said quietly."," \"Are you mad? You can't get her back. She's gone.\" His lips twitched convulsively. \"You saw her.\""," Betty Lou was gazing at Rick intently. \"What happened out there?\" she demanded. \"You saw her.\""," Rick got heavily to his feet and left the living room. In the kitchen he emptied the water in the sink and poured himself a drink. While he was leaning wearily against the sink, Betty Lou appeared in the doorway."," \"What do you want?\" Rick demanded."," The girl's face was flushed an unhealthy red. \"I know something happened out there. You were feeding them, weren't you?\" She advanced towards him. \"You're trying to get her back?\""," \"That's right,\" Rick said."," Betty Lou giggled nervously. \"But you can't. She's dead -- her body's been cremated -- I saw it.\" Her face worked excitedly. \"Daddy always said that something bad would happen to her, and it did.\" She leaned close to Rick. \"She was a witch! She got what she deserved!\""," \"She's coming back,\" Rick said."," \"No!\" Panic stirred the girl's drab features. \"She can't come back. She's dead -- like she always said -- worm into butterfly -- she's a butterfly!\""," \"Go inside,\" Rick said."," \"You can't order me around,\" Betty Lou answered. Her voice rose hysterically. \"This is my house. We don't want you around here any more. Daddy's going to tell you. He doesn't want you and I don't want you and my mother and sister...\""," The change came without warning. Like a film gone dead, Betty Lou froze, her mouth half open, one arm raised, her words dead on her tongue. She was suspended, an instantly lifeless thing raised off the floor, as if caught between two slides of glass. A vacant insect, without speech or sound, inert and hollow. Not dead, but abruptly thinned back to primordial inanimacy."," Into the captured shell filtered new potency and being. It settled over her, a rainbow of life that poured into place eagerly -- like hot fluid -- into every part of her. The girl stumbled and moaned; her body jerked violently and pitched against the wall. A china teacup tumbled from an overhead shelf and smashed on the floor. The girl retreated numbly, one hand to her mouth, her eyes wide with pain and shock."," \"Oh!\" she gasped. \"I cut myself.\" She shook her head and gazed up mutely at him, appealing to him. \"On a nail or something.\""," \"Silvia!\" He caught hold of her and dragged her to her feet, away from the wall. It was her arm he gripped, warm and full and mature. Stunned gray eyes, brown hair, quivering breasts -- she was now as she had been those last moments in the basement."," \"Let's see it,\" he said. He tore her hand from her mouth and shakily examined her finger. There was no cut, only a thin white line rapidly dimming. \"It's all right, honey. You're all right. There's nothing wrong with you!\""," \"Rick, I was over there.\" Her voice was husky and faint. \"They came and dragged me across with them.\" She shuddered violently. \"Rick, am I actually back?\""," He crushed her tight. \"Completely back.\""," \"It was so long. I was over there a century. Endless ages. I thought --\" Suddenly she pulled away. \"Rick...\""," \"What is it?\""," Silvia's face was wild with fear. \"There's something wrong.\""," \"There's nothing wrong. You've come back home and that's all that matters.\""," Silvia retreated from him. \"But they took a living form, didn't they? Not discarded clay. They don't have the power, Rick. They altered His work instead.\" Her voice rose in panic. \"A mistake -- they should have known better than to alter the balance. It's unstable and none of them can control the...\""," Rick blocked the doorway. \"Stop talking like that!\" he said fiercely. \"It's worth it -- anything's worth it. If they set things out of balance, it's their own fault.\""," \"We can't turn it back!\" Her voice rose shrilly, thin and hard, like drawn wire. \"We've set it in motion, started the waves lapping out. The balance He set up is altered.\""," \"Come on, darling,\" Rick said. \"Let's go and sit in the living room with your family. You'll feel better. You'll have to try to recover from this.\""," They approached the three seated figures, two on the couch, one in the traight chair by the fireplace. The figures sat motionless, their faces blank, their bodies limp and waxen, dulled forms that did not respond as the couple entered the room."," Rick halted, uncomprehending. Walter Everett was slumped forward, newspaper in one hand, slippers on his feet; his pipe was still smoking in the deep ashtray on the arm of his chair. Mrs. Everett sat with a lapful of sewing, her face grim and stern, but strangely vague. An unformed face, as if the material were melting and running together. Jean sat huddled in a shapeless heap, a ball of clay wadded up, more formless each moment."," Abruptly Jean collapsed. Her arms fell loose beside her. Her head sagged. Her body, her arms and legs filled out. Her features altered rapidly. Her clothing changed. Colors flowed in her hair, her eyes, her skin. The waxen pallor was gone."," Pressing her fingers to her lips she gazed up at Rick mutely. She blinked and her eyes focused. \"Oh,\" she gasped. Her lips moved awkwardly; the voice was faint and uneven, like a poor soundtrack. She struggled up jerkily, with uncoordinated movements that propelled her stiffly to her feet and towards him -- one awkward step at a time -- like a wire dummy."," \"Rick, I cut myself,\" she said. \"On a nail or something.\""," What had been Mrs. Everett stirred. Shapeless and vague, it made dull sounds and flopped grotesquely. Gradually it hardened and shaped itself. \"My finger,\" its voice gasped feebly. Like mirror echoes dimming off into darkness, the third figure in the easy chair took up the words. Soon, they were all of them repeating the phrase, four fingers, their lips moving in unison."," \"My finger. I cut myself, Rick.\""," Parrot reflections, receding mimicries of words and movement. And the settling shapes were familiar in every detail. Again and again, repeated around him, twice on the couch, in the easy chair, close beside him -- so close he could hear her breath and see her trembling lips."," \"What is it?\" the Silvia beside him asked."," On the couch one Silvia resumed its sewing -- she was sewing methodically, absorbed in her work. In the deep chair another took up its newspapers, its pipe and continued reading. One huddled, nervous and afraid. The one beside him followed as he retreated to the door. She was panting with uncertainty, her gray eyes wide, her nostrils flaring."," \"Rick...\""," He pulled the door open and made his way out onto the dark porch. Machine-like, he felt his way down the steps, through the pools of night collected everywhere, toward the driveway. In the yellow square of light behind him, Silvia was outlined, peering unhappily after him. And behind her, the other figures, identical, pure repetitions, nodding over their tasks."," He found his coupe and pulled out onto the road."," Gloomy trees and houses flashed past. He wondered how far it would go. Lapping waves spreading out -- a widening circle as the imbalance spread."," He turned onto the main highway; there were soon more cars around him. He tried to see into them, but they moved too swiftly. The car ahead was a red Plymouth. A heavyset man in a blue business suit was driving, laughing merrily with the woman beside him. He pulled his own coupe up close behind the Plymouth and followed it. The man flashed gold teeth, grinned, waved his plump hands. The girl was dark-haired, pretty. She smiled at the man, adjusted her white gloves, smoothed down her hair, then rolled up the window on her side."," He lost the Plymouth. A heavy diesel truck cut in between them. Desperately he swerved around the truck and nosed in beyond the swift-moving red sedan. Presently it passed him and, for a moment, the two occupants were clearly framed. The girl resembled Silvia. The same delicate line of her small chin -- the same deep lips, parting slightly when she smiled -- the same slender arms and hands. It was Silvia. The Plymouth turned off and there was no other car ahead of him."," He drove for hours through the heavy night darkness. The gas gauge dropped lower and lower. Ahead of him dismal rolling countryside spread out, blank fields between towns and unwinking stars suspended in the bleak sky. Once, a cluster of red and yellow lights gleamed. An intersection -- filling stations and a big neon sign. He drove on past it."," At a single-pump stand, he pulled the car off the highway, onto the oil-soaked gravel. He climbed out, his shoes crunching the stone underfoot, as he grabbed the gas hose and unscrewed the cap of his car's tank. He had the tank almost full when the door of the drab station building opened and a slim woman in white overalls and navy shirt, with a little cap lost in her brown curls, stepped out."," \"Good evening, Rick,\" she said quietly."," He put back the gas hose. Then he was driving out onto the highway. Had he screwed the cap back on again? He didn't remember. He gained speed. He had gone over a hundred miles. He was nearing the state line."," At a little roadside cafe, warm, yellow light glowed in the chill gloom of early morning. He slowed the car down and parked at the edge of the highway in the deserted parking lot. Bleary-eyed he pushed the door open and entered."," Hot, thick smells of cooking ham and black coffee surrounded him, the comfortable sight of people eating. A jukebox blared in the corner. He threw himself onto a stool and hunched over, his head in his hands. A thin farmer next to him glanced at him curiously and then returned to his newspaper. Two hard-faced women across from him gazed at him momentarily. A handsome youth in denim jacket and jeans was eating red beans and rice, washing it down with steaming coffee from a heavy mug."," \"What'll it be?\" the pert blonde waitress asked, a pencil behind her ear, her hair tied back in a tight bun. \"Looks like you've got some hangover, mister.\""," He ordered coffee and vegetable soup. Soon he was eating, his hands working automatically. He found himself devouring a ham and cheese sandwich; had he ordered it? The jukebox blared and people came and went. There was a little town sprawled beside the road, set back in some gradual hills. Gray sunlight, cold and sterile, filtered down as morning came. He ate hot apple pie and sat wiping dully at his mouth with a napkin."," The cafe was silent. Outside nothing stirred. An uneasy calm hung over everything. The jukebox had ceased. None of the people at the counter stirred or spoke. An occasional truck roared past, damp and lumbering, windows rolled up tight."," When he looked up, Silvia was standing in front of him. Her arms were folded and she gazed vacantly past him. A bright yellow pencil was behind her ear. Her brown hair was tied back in a hard bun. At the corner others were sitting, other Silvias, dishes in front of them, half dozing or eating, some of them reading. Each the same as the next, except for their clothing."," He made his way back to his parked car. In half an hour he had crossed the state line. Cold, bright sunlight sparkled off dew-moist roofs and pavements as he sped through tiny unfamiliar towns."," Along the shiny morning streets he saw them moving -- early risers, on their way to work. In twos and threes they walked, their heels echoing in sharp silence. At bus stops he saw groups of them collected together. In the houses, rising from their beds, eating breakfast, bathing, dressing, were more of them -- hundreds of them, legions without number. A town of them preparing for the day, resuming their regular tasks, as the circle widened and spread."," He left the town behind. The car slowed under him as his foot slid heavily from the gas pedal. Two of them walked across a level field together. They carried books -- children on their way to school. Repetition, unvarying and identical. A dog circled excitedly after them, unconcerned, his joy untainted."," He drove on. Ahead a city loomed, its stern columns of office buildings sharply outlined against the sky. The streets swarmed with noise and activity as he passed through the main business section. Somewhere, near the center of the city, he overtook the expanding periphery of the circle and emerged beyond. Diversity took the place of the endless figures of Silvia. Gray eyes and , brown hair gave way to countless varieties of men and women, children and adults, of all ages and appearances. He increased his speed and raced out on the far side, onto the wide four-lane highway."," He finally slowed down. He was exhausted. He had driven for hours; his body was shaking with fatigue."," Ahead of him a carrot-haired youth was cheerfully thumbing a ride, a thin bean-pole in brown slacks and light camel's-hair sweater. Rick pulled to a halt and opened the front door. \"Hop in,\" he said."," \"Thanks, buddy.\" The youth hurried to the car and climbed in as Rick gathered speed. He slammed the door and settled gratefully back against the seat. \"It was getting hot, standing there.\""," \"How far are you going?\" Rick demanded."," \"All the way to Chicago.\" The youth grinned shyly. \"Of course, I don't expect you to drive me that far. Anything at all is appreciated.\" He eyed Rick curiously. \"Which way you going?\""," \"Anywhere,\" Rick said. \"I'll drive you to Chicago.\""," \"It's two hundred miles!\""," \"Fine,\" Rick said. He steered over into the left lane and gained speed. \"If you want to go to New York, I'll drive you there.\""," \"You feel all right?\" The youth moved away uneasily. \"I sure appreciate a lift, but...\" He hesitated. \"I mean, I don't want to take you out of your way.\""," Rick concentrated on the road ahead, his hands gripping hard around the rim of the wheel. \"I'm going fast. I'm not slowing down or stopping.\""," \"You better be careful,\" the youth warned, in a troubled voice. \"I don't want to get in an accident.\""," \"I'll do the worrying.\""," \"But it's dangerous. What if something happens? It's too risky.\""," \"You're wrong,\" Rick muttered grimly, eyes on the road. \"It's worth the risk.\""," \"But if something goes wrong --\" The voice broke off uncertainly and then continued, \"I might be lost. It would be so easy. It's all so unstable.\" The voice trembled with worry and fear. \"Rick, please...\""," Rick whirled. \"How do you know my name?\""," The youth was crouched in a heap against the door. His face had a soft, molten look, as if it were losing its shape and sliding together in an unformed mass. \"I want to come back,\" he was saying, from within himself, \"but I'm afraid. You haven't seen it -- the region between. It's nothing but energy, Rick. He tapped it a long time ago, but nobody else knows how.\""," The voice lightened, became clear and treble. The hair faded to a rich brown. Gray, frightened eyes flickered up at Rick. Hands frozen, he hunched over the wheel and forced himself not to move. Gradually he decreased speed and brought the car over into the right-hand lane."," \"Are we stopping?\" the shape beside him asked. It was Silvia's voice now. Like a new insect, drying in the sun, the shape hardened and locked into firm reality. Silvia struggled up on the seat and peered out. \"Where are we? We're between towns.\""," He jammed on the brakes, reached past her and threw open the door. \"Get out!\""," Silvia gazed at him uncomprehendingly. \"What do you mean?\" she faltered. \"Rick, what is it? What's wrong?\""," \"Get out!\""," \"Rick, I don't understand.\" She slid over a little. Her toes touched the pavement. \"Is there something wrong with the car? I thought everything was all right.\""," He gently shoved her out and slammed the door. The car leaped ahead, out into the stream of mid-morning traffic. Behind him the small, dazed figure was pulling itself up, bewildered and injured. He forced his eyes from the rearview mirror and crushed down the gas pedal with all his weight."," The radio buzzed and clicked in vague static when he snapped it briefly on. He turned the dial and, after a time, a big network station came in. A faint, puzzled voice, a woman's voice. For a time he couldn't make out the words. Then he recognized it and, with a pang of panic, switched the thing off."," Her voice. Murmuring plaintively. Where was the station? Chicago. The circle had already spread that far."," He slowed down. There was no point hurrying. It had already passed him by and gone on. Kansas farms -- sagging stores in little old Mississippi towns -- along the bleak streets of New England manufacturing cities swarms of brown-haired gray-eyed women would be hurrying."," It would cross the ocean. Soon it would take in the whole world. Africa would be strange -- kraals of white-skinned young women, all exactly alike, going about the primitive chores of hunting and fruit-gathering, mashing grain, skinning animals. Building fires and weaving cloth and carefully shaping razor-sharp knives."," In China... he grinned inanely. She'd look strange there, too. In the austere high-collar suit, the almost monastic robe of the young communist cadres. Parade marching up the main streets of Peiping. Row after row of slim-legged full-breasted girls, with heavy Russian-made rifles. Carrying spades, picks, shovels. Columns of cloth-booted soldiers. Fast-moving workers with their precious tools. Reviewed by an identical figure on the elaborate stand overlooking the street, one slender arm raised, her gentle, pretty face expressionless and wooden."," He turned off the highway onto a side road. A moment later he was on his way back, driving slowly, listlessly, the way he had come."," At an intersection a traffic cop waded out through traffic to his car. He sat rigid, hands on the wheel, waiting numbly."," \"Rick\" she whispered pleadingly as she reached the window. \"Isn't everything all right?\""," \"Sure,\" he answered dully."," She reached in through the open window and touched him imploringly on the arm. Familiar fingers, red nails, the hand he knew so well, \"I want to be with you so badly. Aren't we together again? Aren't I back?\""," \"Sure.\" -"," She shook her head miserably. \"I don't understand,\" she repeated. \"I thought it was all right again.\""," Savagely he put the car into motion and hurtled ahead. The intersection was left behind."," It was afternoon. He was exhausted, riddled with fatigue. He guided the car towards his own town automatically. Along the streets she hurried everywhere, on all sides. She was omnipresent. He came to his apartment building and parked."," The janitor greeted him in the empty hall. Rick identified him by the greasy rag clutched in one hand, the big push-broom, the bucket of wood shavings. \"Please,\" she implored, \"tell me what it is, Rick. Please tell me.\""," He pushed past her, but she caught at him desperately. \"Rick, I'm back. Don't you understand? They took me too soon and then they sent me back again. It was a mistake. I won't ever call them again -- that's all in the past.\" She followed after him, down the hall to the stairs. \"I'm never going to call them again.\""," He climbed the stairs. Silvia hesitated, then settled down on the bottom step in a wretched, unhappy heap, a tiny figure in thick workman's clothing and huge cleated boots."," He unlocked his apartment door and entered."," The late afternoon sky was a deep blue beyond the windows. The roofs of nearby apartment buildings sparkled white in the sun."," His body ached. He wandered clumsily into the bathroom -- it seemed alien and unfamiliar, a difficult place to find. He filled the bowl with hot water, rolled up his sleeves and washed his face and hands in the swirling hot stream. Briefly, he glanced up."," It was a terrified reflection that showed out of the mirror above the bowl, a face, tear-stained and frantic. The face was difficult to catch -- it seemed to waver and slide. Gray eyes, bright with terror. Trembling red mouth, pulse-fluttering throat, soft brown hair. The face gazed out pathetically -- and then the girl at the bowl bent to dry herself."," She turned and moved wearily out of the bathroom into the living room."," Confused, she hesitated, then threw herself onto a chair and closed her eyes, sick with misery and fatigue."," \"Rick,\" she murmured pleadingly. \"Try to help me. I'm back, aren't I?\" She shook her head, bewildered. \"Please, Rick, I thought everything was all right.\""],"excerpt":"Silvia ran laughing through the night brightness, between the roses and cosmos and Shasta daisies, down the gravel path and beyond the heaps of sweet-tasting grass swept from the lawns. Stars, caught in pools of water, glittered everywhere, as she brushed through them to the slope beyond the brick wall. Cedars supported the sky and ignored the slim shape squeezing past, her brown hair flying, her eyes flashing.\n\n\"Wait for me,\" Rick complained, as he cautiously threaded his way after her, along t"},{"key":"mrspaceship","display":"Mr. Spaceship","path":"/mr-spaceship","year":1953,"wordcount":11021,"readtime":41.59,"paragraphs":[" A human brain-controlled spacecraft would mean mechanical perfection. This was accomplished, and something unforeseen: a strange entity called-- Mr. Spaceship.","",""," Kramer leaned back. \"You can see the situation. How can we deal with a factor like this? The perfect variable.\""," \"Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material. But the cause-effect chain is more subtle; there are more factors to be considered. The difference is quantitative, I think. The reaction of the living organism parallels natural causation, but with greater complexity.\""," Gross and Kramer looked up at the board plates, suspended on the wall, still dripping, the images hardening into place. Kramer traced a line with his pencil."," \"See that? It's a pseudopodium. They're alive, and so far, a weapon we can't beat. No mechanical system can compete with that, simple or intricate. We'll have to scrap the Johnson Control and find something else.\""," \"Meanwhile the war continues as it is. Stalemate. Checkmate. They can't get to us, and we can't get through their living minefield.\""," Kramer nodded. \"It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still might be one answer.\""," \"What's that?\""," \"Wait a minute.\" Kramer turned to his rocket expert, sitting with the charts and files. \"The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no contact.\""," \"Correct.\" The expert nodded. \"The mine was twenty miles off. The cruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima, line-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its course. That was when they got it.\""," \"It shifted,\" Kramer said. \"But not enough. The mine was coming along after it, trailing it. It's the same old story, but I wonder about the contact.\""," \"Here's our theory,\" the expert said. \"We keep looking for contact, a trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative. We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine decides to blow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.\""," \"Thanks.\" Kramer turned to Gross. \"Well, that confirms what I'm saying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that decides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you must avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of mind in a complicated, developed life-form.\""," \"The belt is fifty thousand miles deep,\" Gross added. \"It solves another problem for them, repair and maintenance. The damn things reproduce, fill up the spaces by spawning into them. I wonder what they feed on?\""," \"Probably the remains of our first-line. The big cruisers must be a delicacy. It's a game of wits, between a living creature and a ship piloted by automatic relays. The ship always loses.\" Kramer opened a folder. \"I'll tell you what I suggest.\""," \"Go on,\" Gross said. \"I've already heard ten solutions today. What's yours?\""," \"Mine is very simple. These creatures are superior to any mechanical system, but only because they're alive. Almost any other life-form could compete with them, any higher life-form. If the yuks can put out living mines to protect their planets, we ought to be able to harness some of our own life-forms in a similar way. Let's make use of the same weapon ourselves.\""," \"Which life-form do you propose to use?\""," \"I think the human brain is the most agile of known living forms. Do you know of any better?\""," \"But no human being can withstand outspace travel. A human pilot would be dead of heart failure long before the ship got anywhere near Proxima.\""," \"But we don't need the whole body,\" Kramer said. \"We need only the brain.\""," \"What?\""," \"The problem is to find a person of high intelligence who would contribute, in the same manner that eyes and arms are volunteered.\""," \"But a brain....\""," \"Technically, it could be done. Brains have been transferred several times, when body destruction made it necessary. Of course, to a spaceship, to a heavy outspace cruiser, instead of an artificial body, that's new.\""," The room was silent."," \"It's quite an idea,\" Gross said slowly. His heavy square face twisted. \"But even supposing it might work, the big question is whose brain?\""," It was all very confusing, the reasons for the war, the nature of the enemy. The Yucconae had been contacted on one of the outlying planets of Proxima Centauri. At the approach of the Terran ship, a host of dark slim pencils had lifted abruptly and shot off into the distance. The first real encounter came between three of the yuk pencils and a single exploration ship from Terra. No Terrans survived. After that it was all out war, with no holds barred."," Both sides feverishly constructed defense rings around their systems. Of the two, the Yucconae belt was the better. The ring around Proxima was a living ring, superior to anything Terra could throw against it. The standard equipment by which Terran ships were guided in outspace, the Johnson Control, was not adequate. Something more was needed. Automatic relays were not good enough."," --Not good at all, Kramer thought to himself, as he stood looking down the hillside at the work going on below him. A warm wind blew along the hill, rustling the weeds and grass. At the bottom, in the valley, the mechanics had almost finished; the last elements of the reflex system had been removed from the ship and crated up."," All that was needed now was the new core, the new central key that would take the place of the mechanical system. A human brain, the brain of an intelligent, wary human being. But would the human being part with it? That was the problem."," Kramer turned. Two people were approaching him along the road, a man and a woman. The man was Gross, expressionless, heavy-set, walking with dignity. The woman was--He stared in surprise and growing annoyance. It was Dolores, his wife. Since they'd separated he had seen little of her...."," \"Kramer,\" Gross said. \"Look who I ran into. Come back down with us. We're going into town.\""," \"Hello, Phil,\" Dolores said. \"Well, aren't you glad to see me?\""," He nodded. \"How have you been? You're looking fine.\" She was still pretty and slender in her uniform, the blue-grey of Internal Security, Gross' organization."," \"Thanks.\" She smiled. \"You seem to be doing all right, too. Commander Gross tells me that you're responsible for this project, Operation Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?\""," \"That's the problem.\" Kramer lit a cigarette. \"This ship is to be equipped with a human brain instead of the Johnson system. We've constructed special draining baths for the brain, electronic relays to catch the impulses and magnify them, a continual feeding duct that supplies the living cells with everything they need. But--\""," \"But we still haven't got the brain itself,\" Gross finished. They began to walk back toward the car. \"If we can get that we'll be ready for the tests.\""," \"Will the brain remain alive?\" Dolores asked. \"Is it actually going to live as part of the ship?\""," \"It will be alive, but not conscious. Very little life is actually conscious. Animals, trees, insects are quick in their responses, but they aren't conscious. In this process of ours the individual personality, the ego, will cease. We only need the response ability, nothing more.\""," Dolores shuddered. \"How terrible!\""," \"In time of war everything must be tried,\" Kramer said absently. \"If one life sacrificed will end the war it's worth it. This ship might get through. A couple more like it and there wouldn't be any more war.\""," They got into the car. As they drove down the road, Gross said, \"Have you thought of anyone yet?\""," Kramer shook his head. \"That's out of my line.\""," \"What do you mean?\""," \"I'm an engineer. It's not in my department.\""," \"But all this was your idea.\""," \"My work ends there.\""," Gross was staring at him oddly. Kramer shifted uneasily."," \"Then who is supposed to do it?\" Gross said. \"I can have my organization prepare examinations of various kinds, to determine fitness, that kind of thing--\""," \"Listen, Phil,\" Dolores said suddenly."," \"What?\""," She turned toward him. \"I have an idea. Do you remember that professor we had in college. Michael Thomas?\""," Kramer nodded."," \"I wonder if he's still alive.\" Dolores frowned. \"If he is he must be awfully old.\""," \"Why, Dolores?\" Gross asked."," \"Perhaps an old person who didn't have much time left, but whose mind was still clear and sharp--\""," \"Professor Thomas.\" Kramer rubbed his jaw. \"He certainly was a wise old duck. But could he still be alive? He must have been seventy, then.\""," \"We could find that out,\" Gross said. \"I could make a routine check.\""," \"What do you think?\" Dolores said. \"If any human mind could outwit those creatures--\""," \"I don't like the idea,\" Kramer said. In his mind an image had appeared, the image of an old man sitting behind a desk, his bright gentle eyes moving about the classroom. The old man leaning forward, a thin hand raised--"," \"Keep him out of this,\" Kramer said."," \"What's wrong?\" Gross looked at him curiously."," \"It's because I suggested it,\" Dolores said."," \"No.\" Kramer shook his head. \"It's not that. I didn't expect anything like this, somebody I knew, a man I studied under. I remember him very clearly. He was a very distinct personality.\""," \"Good,\" Gross said. \"He sounds fine.\""," \"We can't do it. We're asking his death!\""," \"This is war,\" Gross said, \"and war doesn't wait on the needs of the individual. You said that yourself. Surely he'll volunteer; we can keep it on that basis.\""," \"He may already be dead,\" Dolores murmured."," \"We'll find that out,\" Gross said speeding up the car. They drove the rest of the way in silence."," *****"," For a long time the two of them stood studying the small wood house, overgrown with ivy, set back on the lot behind an enormous oak. The little town was silent and sleepy; once in awhile a car moved slowly along the distant highway, but that was all."," \"This is the place,\" Gross said to Kramer. He folded his arms. \"Quite a quaint little house.\""," Kramer said nothing. The two Security Agents behind them were expressionless."," Gross started toward the gate. \"Let's go. According to the check he's still alive, but very sick. His mind is agile, however. That seems to be certain. It's said he doesn't leave the house. A woman takes care of his needs. He's very frail.\""," They went down the stone walk and up onto the porch. Gross rang the bell. They waited. After a time they heard slow footsteps. The door opened. An elderly woman in a shapeless wrapper studied them impassively."," \"Security,\" Gross said, showing his card. \"We wish to see Professor Thomas.\""," \"Why?\""," \"Government business.\" He glanced at Kramer."," Kramer stepped forward. \"I was a pupil of the Professor's,\" he said. \"I'm sure he won't mind seeing us.\""," The woman hesitated uncertainly. Gross stepped into the doorway. \"All right, mother. This is war time. We can't stand out here.\""," The two Security agents followed him, and Kramer came reluctantly behind, closing the door. Gross stalked down the hall until he came to an open door. He stopped, looking in. Kramer could see the white corner of a bed, a wooden post and the edge of a dresser."," He joined Gross."," In the dark room a withered old man lay, propped up on endless pillows. At first it seemed as if he were asleep; there was no motion or sign of life. But after a time Kramer saw with a faint shock that the old man was watching them intently, his eyes fixed on them, unmoving, unwinking."," \"Professor Thomas?\" Gross said. \"I'm Commander Gross of Security. This man with me is perhaps known to you--\""," The faded eyes fixed on Kramer."," \"I know him. Philip Kramer.... You've grown heavier, boy.\" The voice was feeble, the rustle of dry ashes. \"Is it true you're married now?\""," \"Yes. I married Dolores French. You remember her.\" Kramer came toward the bed. \"But we're separated. It didn't work out very well. Our careers--\""," \"What we came here about, Professor,\" Gross began, but Kramer cut him off with an impatient wave."," \"Let me talk. Can't you and your men get out of here long enough to let me talk to him?\""," Gross swallowed. \"All right, Kramer.\" He nodded to the two men. The three of them left the room, going out into the hall and closing the door after them."," The old man in the bed watched Kramer silently. \"I don't think much of him,\" he said at last. \"I've seen his type before. What's he want?\""," \"Nothing. He just came along. Can I sit down?\" Kramer found a stiff upright chair beside the bed. \"If I'm bothering you--\""," \"No. I'm glad to see you again, Philip. After so long. I'm sorry your marriage didn't work out.\""," \"How have you been?\""," \"I've been very ill. I'm afraid that my moment on the world's stage has almost ended.\" The ancient eyes studied the younger man reflectively. \"You look as if you have been doing well. Like everyone else I thought highly of. You've gone to the top in this society.\""," Kramer smiled. Then he became serious. \"Professor, there's a project we're working on that I want to talk to you about. It's the first ray of hope we've had in this whole war. If it works, we may be able to crack the yuk defenses, get some ships into their system. If we can do that the war might be brought to an end.\""," \"Go on. Tell me about it, if you wish.\""," \"It's a long shot, this project. It may not work at all, but we have to give it a try.\""," \"It's obvious that you came here because of it,\" Professor Thomas murmured. \"I'm becoming curious. Go on.\""," *****"," After Kramer finished the old man lay back in the bed without speaking. At last he sighed."," \"I understand. A human mind, taken out of a human body.\" He sat up a little, looking at Kramer. \"I suppose you're thinking of me.\""," Kramer said nothing."," \"Before I make my decision I want to see the papers on this, the theory and outline of construction. I'm not sure I like it.--For reasons of my own, I mean. But I want to look at the material. If you'll do that--\""," \"Certainly.\" Kramer stood up and went to the door. Gross and the two Security Agents were standing outside, waiting tensely. \"Gross, come inside.\""," They filed into the room."," \"Give the Professor the papers,\" Kramer said. \"He wants to study them before deciding.\""," Gross brought the file out of his coat pocket, a manila envelope. He handed it to the old man on the bed. \"Here it is, Professor. You're welcome to examine it. Will you give us your answer as soon as possible? We're very anxious to begin, of course.\""," \"I'll give you my answer when I've decided.\" He took the envelope with a thin, trembling hand. \"My decision depends on what I find out from these papers. If I don't like what I find, then I will not become involved with this work in any shape or form.\" He opened the envelope with shaking hands. \"I'm looking for one thing.\""," \"What is it?\" Gross said."," \"That's my affair. Leave me a number by which I can reach you when I've decided.\""," Silently, Gross put his card down on the dresser. As they went out Professor Thomas was already reading the first of the papers, the outline of the theory."," *****"," Kramer sat across from Dale Winter, his second in line. \"What then?\" Winter said."," \"He's going to contact us.\" Kramer scratched with a drawing pen on some paper. \"I don't know what to think.\""," \"What do you mean?\" Winter's good-natured face was puzzled."," \"Look.\" Kramer stood up, pacing back and forth, his hands in his uniform pockets. \"He was my teacher in college. I respected him as a man, as well as a teacher. He was more than a voice, a talking book. He was a person, a calm, kindly person I could look up to. I always wanted to be like him, someday. Now look at me.\""," \"So?\""," \"Look at what I'm asking. I'm asking for his life, as if he were some kind of laboratory animal kept around in a cage, not a man, a teacher at all.\""," \"Do you think he'll do it?\""," \"I don't know.\" Kramer went to the window. He stood looking out. \"In a way, I hope not.\""," \"But if he doesn't--\""," \"Then we'll have to find somebody else. I know. There would be somebody else. Why did Dolores have to--\""," The vidphone rang. Kramer pressed the button."," \"This is Gross.\" The heavy features formed. \"The old man called me. Professor Thomas.\""," \"What did he say?\" He knew; he could tell already, by the sound of Gross' voice."," \"He said he'd do it. I was a little surprised myself, but apparently he means it. We've already made arrangements for his admission to the hospital. His lawyer is drawing up the statement of liability.\""," Kramer only half heard. He nodded wearily. \"All right. I'm glad. I suppose we can go ahead, then.\""," \"You don't sound very glad.\""," \"I wonder why he decided to go ahead with it.\""," \"He was very certain about it.\" Gross sounded pleased. \"He called me quite early. I was still in bed. You know, this calls for a celebration.\""," \"Sure,\" Kramer said. \"It sure does.\""," *****"," Toward the middle of August the project neared completion. They stood outside in the hot autumn heat, looking up at the sleek metal sides of the ship."," Gross thumped the metal with his hand. \"Well, it won't be long. We can begin the test any time.\""," \"Tell us more about this,\" an officer in gold braid said. \"It's such an unusual concept.\""," \"Is there really a human brain inside the ship?\" a dignitary asked, a small man in a rumpled suit. \"And the brain is actually alive?\""," \"Gentlemen, this ship is guided by a living brain instead of the usual Johnson relay-control system. But the brain is not conscious. It will function by reflex only. The practical difference between it and the Johnson system is this: a human brain is far more intricate than any man-made structure, and its ability to adapt itself to a situation, to respond to danger, is far beyond anything that could be artificially built.\""," Gross paused, cocking his ear. The turbines of the ship were beginning to rumble, shaking the ground under them with a deep vibration. Kramer was standing a short distance away from the others, his arms folded, watching silently. At the sound of the turbines he walked quickly around the ship to the other side. A few workmen were clearing away the last of the waste, the scraps of wiring and scaffolding. They glanced up at him and went on hurriedly with their work. Kramer mounted the ramp and entered the control cabin of the ship. Winter was sitting at the controls with a Pilot from Space-transport."," \"How's it look?\" Kramer asked."," \"All right.\" Winter got up. \"He tells me that it would be best to take off manually. The robot controls--\" Winter hesitated. \"I mean, the built-in controls, can take over later on in space.\""," \"That's right,\" the Pilot said. \"It's customary with the Johnson system, and so in this case we should--\""," \"Can you tell anything yet?\" Kramer asked."," \"No,\" the Pilot said slowly. \"I don't think so. I've been going over everything. It seems to be in good order. There's only one thing I wanted to ask you about.\" He put his hand on the control board. \"There are some changes here I don't understand.\""," \"Changes?\""," \"Alterations from the original design. I wonder what the purpose is.\""," Kramer took a set of the plans from his coat. \"Let me look.\" He turned the pages over. The Pilot watched carefully over his shoulder."," \"The changes aren't indicated on your copy,\" the Pilot said. \"I wonder--\" He stopped. Commander Gross had entered the control cabin."," \"Gross, who authorized alterations?\" Kramer said. \"Some of the wiring has been changed.\""," \"Why, your old friend.\" Gross signaled to the field tower through the window."," \"My old friend?\""," \"The Professor. He took quite an active interest.\" Gross turned to the Pilot. \"Let's get going. We have to take this out past gravity for the test they tell me. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Are you ready?\""," \"Sure.\" The Pilot sat down and moved some of the controls around. \"Anytime.\""," \"Go ahead, then,\" Gross said."," \"The Professor--\" Kramer began, but at that moment there was a tremendous roar and the ship leaped under him. He grasped one of the wall holds and hung on as best he could. The cabin was filling with a steady throbbing, the raging of the jet turbines underneath them."," The ship leaped. Kramer closed his eyes and held his breath. They were moving out into space, gaining speed each moment."," *****"," \"Well, what do you think?\" Winter said nervously. \"Is it time yet?\""," \"A little longer,\" Kramer said. He was sitting on the floor of the cabin, down by the control wiring. He had removed the metal covering-plate, exposing the complicated maze of relay wiring. He was studying it, comparing it to the wiring diagrams."," \"What's the matter?\" Gross said."," \"These changes. I can't figure out what they're for. The only pattern I can make out is that for some reason--\""," \"Let me look,\" the Pilot said. He squatted down beside Kramer. \"You were saying?\""," \"See this lead here? Originally it was switch controlled. It closed and opened automatically, according to temperature change. Now it's wired so that the central control system operates it. The same with the others. A lot of this was still mechanical, worked by pressure, temperature, stress. Now it's under the central master.\""," \"The brain?\" Gross said. \"You mean it's been altered so that the brain manipulates it?\""," Kramer nodded. \"Maybe Professor Thomas felt that no mechanical relays could be trusted. Maybe he thought that things would be happening too fast. But some of these could close in a split second. The brake rockets could go on as quickly as--\""," \"Hey,\" Winter said from the control seat. \"We're getting near the moon stations. What'll I do?\""," They looked out the port. The corroded surface of the moon gleamed up at them, a corrupt and sickening sight. They were moving swiftly toward it."," \"I'll take it,\" the Pilot said. He eased Winter out of the way and strapped himself in place. The ship began to move away from the moon as he manipulated the controls. Down below them they could see the observation stations dotting the surface, and the tiny squares that were the openings of the underground factories and hangars. A red blinker winked up at them and the Pilot's fingers moved on the board in answer."," \"We're past the moon,\" the Pilot said, after a time. The moon had fallen behind them; the ship was heading into outer space. \"Well, we can go ahead with it.\""," Kramer did not answer."," \"Mr. Kramer, we can go ahead any time.\""," Kramer started. \"Sorry. I was thinking. All right, thanks.\" He frowned, deep in thought."," \"What is it?\" Gross asked."," \"The wiring changes. Did you understand the reason for them when you gave the okay to the workmen?\""," Gross flushed. \"You know I know nothing about technical material. I'm in Security.\""," \"Then you should have consulted me.\""," \"What does it matter?\" Gross grinned wryly. \"We're going to have to start putting our faith in the old man sooner or later.\""," The Pilot stepped back from the board. His face was pale and set. \"Well, it's done,\" he said. \"That's it.\""," \"What's done?\" Kramer said."," \"We're on automatic. The brain. I turned the board over to it--to him, I mean. The Old Man.\" The Pilot lit a cigarette and puffed nervously. \"Let's keep our fingers crossed.\""," *****"," The ship was coasting evenly, in the hands of its invisible pilot. Far down inside the ship, carefully armoured and protected, a soft human brain lay in a tank of liquid, a thousand minute electric charges playing over its surface. As the charges rose they were picked up and amplified, fed into relay systems, advanced, carried on through the entire ship--"," Gross wiped his forehead nervously. \"So he is running it, now. I hope he knows what he's doing.\""," Kramer nodded enigmatically. \"I think he does.\""," \"What do you mean?\""," \"Nothing.\" Kramer walked to the port. \"I see we're still moving in a straight line.\" He picked up the microphone. \"We can instruct the brain orally, through this.\" He blew against the microphone experimentally."," \"Go on,\" Winter said."," \"Bring the ship around half-right,\" Kramer said. \"Decrease speed.\""," They waited. Time passed. Gross looked at Kramer. \"No change. Nothing.\""," \"Wait.\""," Slowly, the ship was beginning to turn. The turbines missed, reducing their steady beat. The ship was taking up its new course, adjusting itself. Nearby some space debris rushed past, incinerating in the blasts of the turbine jets."," \"So far so good,\" Gross said."," They began to breathe more easily. The invisible pilot had taken control smoothly, calmly. The ship was in good hands. Kramer spoke a few more words into the microphone, and they swung again. Now they were moving back the way they had come, toward the moon."," \"Let's see what he does when we enter the moon's pull,\" Kramer said. \"He was a good mathematician, the old man. He could handle any kind of problem.\""," The ship veered, turning away from the moon. The great eaten-away globe fell behind them."," Gross breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's that.\""," \"One more thing.\" Kramer picked up the microphone. \"Return to the moon and land the ship at the first space field,\" he said into it."," \"Good Lord,\" Winter murmured. \"Why are you--\""," \"Be quiet.\" Kramer stood, listening. The turbines gasped and roared as the ship swung full around, gaining speed. They were moving back, back toward the moon again. The ship dipped down, heading toward the great globe below."," \"We're going a little fast,\" the Pilot said. \"I don't see how he can put down at this velocity.\""," *****"," The port filled up, as the globe swelled rapidly. The Pilot hurried toward the board, reaching for the controls. All at once the ship jerked. The nose lifted and the ship shot out into space, away from the moon, turning at an oblique angle. The men were thrown to the floor by the sudden change in course. They got to their feet again, speechless, staring at each other."," The Pilot gazed down at the board. \"It wasn't me! I didn't touch a thing. I didn't even get to it.\""," The ship was gaining speed each moment. Kramer hesitated. \"Maybe you better switch it back to manual.\""," The Pilot closed the switch. He took hold of the steering controls and moved them experimentally. \"Nothing.\" He turned around. \"Nothing. It doesn't respond.\""," No one spoke."," \"You can see what has happened,\" Kramer said calmly. \"The old man won't let go of it, now that he has it. I was afraid of this when I saw the wiring changes. Everything in this ship is centrally controlled, even the cooling system, the hatches, the garbage release. We're helpless.\""," \"Nonsense.\" Gross strode to the board. He took hold of the wheel and turned it. The ship continued on its course, moving away from the moon, leaving it behind."," \"Release!\" Kramer said into the microphone. \"Let go of the controls! We'll take it back. Release.\""," \"No good,\" the Pilot said. \"Nothing.\" He spun the useless wheel. \"It's dead, completely dead.\""," \"And we're still heading out,\" Winter said, grinning foolishly. \"We'll be going through the first-line defense belt in a few minutes. If they don't shoot us down--\""," \"We better radio back.\" The Pilot clicked the radio to send. \"I'll contact the main bases, one of the observation stations.\""," \"Better get the defense belt, at the speed we're going. We'll be into it in a minute.\""," \"And after that,\" Kramer said, \"we'll be in outer space. He's moving us toward outspace velocity. Is this ship equipped with baths?\""," \"Baths?\" Gross said."," \"The sleep tanks. For space-drive. We may need them if we go much faster.\""," \"But good God, where are we going?\" Gross said. \"Where--where's he taking us?\""," *****"," The Pilot obtained contact. \"This is Dwight, on ship,\" he said. \"We're entering the defense zone at high velocity. Don't fire on us.\""," \"Turn back,\" the impersonal voice came through the speaker. \"You're not allowed in the defense zone.\""," \"We can't. We've lost control.\""," \"Lost control?\""," \"This is an experimental ship.\""," Gross took the radio. \"This is Commander Gross, Security. We're being carried into outer space. There's nothing we can do. Is there any way that we can be removed from this ship?\""," A hesitation. \"We have some fast pursuit ships that could pick you up if you wanted to jump. The chances are good they'd find you. Do you have space flares?\""," \"We do,\" the Pilot said. \"Let's try it.\""," \"Abandon ship?\" Kramer said. \"If we leave now we'll never see it again.\""," \"What else can we do? We're gaining speed all the time. Do you propose that we stay here?\""," \"No.\" Kramer shook his head. \"Damn it, there ought to be a better solution.\""," \"Could you contact him?\" Winter asked. \"The Old Man? Try to reason with him?\""," \"It's worth a chance,\" Gross said. \"Try it.\""," \"All right.\" Kramer took the microphone. He paused a moment. \"Listen! Can you hear me? This is Phil Kramer. Can you hear me, Professor. Can you hear me? I want you to release the controls.\""," There was silence."," \"This is Kramer, Professor. Can you hear me? Do you remember who I am? Do you understand who this is?\""," Above the control panel the wall speaker made a sound, a sputtering static. They looked up."," \"Can you hear me, Professor. This is Philip Kramer. I want you to give the ship back to us. If you can hear me, release the controls! Let go, Professor. Let go!\""," Static. A rushing sound, like the wind. They gazed at each other. There was silence for a moment."," \"It's a waste of time,\" Gross said."," \"No--listen!\""," The sputter came again. Then, mixed with the sputter, almost lost in it, a voice came, toneless, without inflection, a mechanical, lifeless voice from the metal speaker in the wall, above their heads."," \"... Is it you, Philip? I can't make you out. Darkness.... Who's there? With you....\""," \"It's me, Kramer.\" His fingers tightened against the microphone handle. \"You must release the controls, Professor. We have to get back to Terra. You must.\""," Silence. Then the faint, faltering voice came again, a little stronger than before. \"Kramer. Everything so strange. I was right, though. Consciousness result of thinking. Necessary result. Cognito ergo sum. Retain conceptual ability. Can you hear me?\""," \"Yes, Professor--\""," \"I altered the wiring. Control. I was fairly certain.... I wonder if I can do it. Try....\""," Suddenly the air-conditioning snapped into operation. It snapped abruptly off again. Down the corridor a door slammed. Something thudded. The men stood listening. Sounds came from all sides of them, switches shutting, opening. The lights blinked off; they were in darkness. The lights came back on, and at the same time the heating coils dimmed and faded."," \"Good God!\" Winter said."," Water poured down on them, the emergency fire-fighting system. There was a screaming rush of air. One of the escape hatches had slid back, and the air was roaring frantically out into space."," The hatch banged closed. The ship subsided into silence. The heating coils glowed into life. As suddenly as it had begun the weird exhibition ceased."," \"I can do--everything,\" the dry, toneless voice came from the wall speaker. \"It is all controlled. Kramer, I wish to talk to you. I've been--been thinking. I haven't seen you in many years. A lot to discuss. You've changed, boy. We have much to discuss. Your wife--\""," The Pilot grabbed Kramer's arm. \"There's a ship standing off our bow. Look.\""," *****"," They ran to the port. A slender pale craft was moving along with them, keeping pace with them. It was signal-blinking."," \"A Terran pursuit ship,\" the Pilot said. \"Let's jump. They'll pick us up. Suits--\""," He ran to a supply cupboard and turned the handle. The door opened and he pulled the suits out onto the floor."," \"Hurry,\" Gross said. A panic seized them. They dressed frantically, pulling the heavy garments over them. Winter staggered to the escape hatch and stood by it, waiting for the others. They joined him, one by one."," \"Let's go!\" Gross said. \"Open the hatch.\""," Winter tugged at the hatch. \"Help me.\""," They grabbed hold, tugging together. Nothing happened. The hatch refused to budge."," \"Get a crowbar,\" the Pilot said."," \"Hasn't anyone got a blaster?\" Gross looked frantically around. \"Damn it, blast it open!\""," \"Pull,\" Kramer grated. \"Pull together.\""," \"Are you at the hatch?\" the toneless voice came, drifting and eddying through the corridors of the ship. They looked up, staring around them. \"I sense something nearby, outside. A ship? You are leaving, all of you? Kramer, you are leaving, too? Very unfortunate. I had hoped we could talk. Perhaps at some other time you might be induced to remain.\""," \"Open the hatch!\" Kramer said, staring up at the impersonal walls of the ship. \"For God's sake, open it!\""," There was silence, an endless pause. Then, very slowly, the hatch slid back. The air screamed out, rushing past them into space."," One by one they leaped, one after the other, propelled away by the repulsive material of the suits. A few minutes later they were being hauled aboard the pursuit ship. As the last one of them was lifted through the port, their own ship pointed itself suddenly upward and shot off at tremendous speed. It disappeared."," Kramer removed his helmet, gasping. Two sailors held onto him and began to wrap him in blankets. Gross sipped a mug of coffee, shivering."," \"It's gone,\" Kramer murmured."," \"I'll have an alarm sent out,\" Gross said."," \"What's happened to your ship?\" a sailor asked curiously. \"It sure took off in a hurry. Who's on it?\""," \"We'll have to have it destroyed,\" Gross went on, his face grim. \"It's got to be destroyed. There's no telling what it--what he has in mind.\" Gross sat down weakly on a metal bench. \"What a close call for us. We were so damn trusting.\""," \"What could he be planning,\" Kramer said, half to himself. \"It doesn't make sense. I don't get it.\""," *****"," As the ship sped back toward the moon base they sat around the table in the dining room, sipping hot coffee and thinking, not saying very much."," \"Look here,\" Gross said at last. \"What kind of man was Professor Thomas? What do you remember about him?\""," Kramer put his coffee mug down. \"It was ten years ago. I don't remember much. It's vague.\""," He let his mind run back over the years. He and Dolores had been at Hunt College together, in physics and the life sciences. The College was small and set back away from the momentum of modern life. He had gone there because it was his home town, and his father had gone there before him."," Professor Thomas had been at the College a long time, as long as anyone could remember. He was a strange old man, keeping to himself most of the time. There were many things that he disapproved of, but he seldom said what they were."," \"Do you recall anything that might help us?\" Gross asked. \"Anything that would give us a clue as to what he might have in mind?\""," Kramer nodded slowly. \"I remember one thing....\""," One day he and the Professor had been sitting together in the school chapel, talking leisurely."," \"Well, you'll be out of school, soon,\" the Professor had said. \"What are you going to do?\""," \"Do? Work at one of the Government Research Projects, I suppose.\""," \"And eventually? What's your ultimate goal?\""," Kramer had smiled. \"The question is unscientific. It presupposes such things as ultimate ends.\""," \"Suppose instead along these lines, then: What if there were no war and no Government Research Projects? What would you do, then?\""," \"I don't know. But how can I imagine a hypothetical situation like that? There's been war as long as I can remember. We're geared for war. I don't know what I'd do. I suppose I'd adjust, get used to it.\""," The Professor had stared at him. \"Oh, you do think you'd get accustomed to it, eh? Well, I'm glad of that. And you think you could find something to do?\""," Gross listened intently. \"What do you infer from this, Kramer?\""," \"Not much. Except that he was against war.\""," \"We're all against war,\" Gross pointed out."," \"True. But he was withdrawn, set apart. He lived very simply, cooking his own meals. His wife died many years ago. He was born in Europe, in Italy. He changed his name when he came to the United States. He used to read Dante and Milton. He even had a Bible.\""," \"Very anachronistic, don't you think?\""," \"Yes, he lived quite a lot in the past. He found an old phonograph and records, and he listened to the old music. You saw his house, how old-fashioned it was.\""," \"Did he have a file?\" Winter asked Gross."," \"With Security? No, none at all. As far as we could tell he never engaged in political work, never joined anything or even seemed to have strong political convictions.\""," \"No,\" Kramer, agreed. \"About all he ever did was walk through the hills. He liked nature.\""," \"Nature can be of great use to a scientist,\" Gross said. \"There wouldn't be any science without it.\""," \"Kramer, what do you think his plan is, taking control of the ship and disappearing?\" Winter said."," \"Maybe the transfer made him insane,\" the Pilot said. \"Maybe there's no plan, nothing rational at all.\""," \"But he had the ship rewired, and he had made sure that he would retain consciousness and memory before he even agreed to the operation. He must have had something planned from the start. But what?\""," \"Perhaps he just wanted to stay alive longer,\" Kramer said. \"He was old and about to die. Or--\""," \"Or what?\""," \"Nothing.\" Kramer stood up. \"I think as soon as we get to the moon base I'll make a vidcall to earth. I want to talk to somebody about this.\""," \"Who's that?\" Gross asked."," \"Dolores. Maybe she remembers something.\""," \"That's a good idea,\" Gross said."," *****"," \"Where are you calling from?\" Dolores asked, when he succeeded in reaching her."," \"From the moon base.\""," \"All kinds of rumors are running around. Why didn't the ship come back? What happened?\""," \"I'm afraid he ran off with it.\""," \"He?\""," \"The Old Man. Professor Thomas.\" Kramer explained what had happened."," Dolores listened intently. \"How strange. And you think he planned it all in advance, from the start?\""," \"I'm certain. He asked for the plans of construction and the theoretical diagrams at once.\""," \"But why? What for?\""," \"I don't know. Look, Dolores. What do you remember about him? Is there anything that might give a clue to all this?\""," \"Like what?\""," \"I don't know. That's the trouble.\""," On the vidscreen Dolores knitted her brow. \"I remember he raised chickens in his back yard, and once he had a goat.\" She smiled. \"Do you remember the day the goat got loose and wandered down the main street of town? Nobody could figure out where it came from.\""," \"Anything else?\""," \"No.\" He watched her struggling, trying to remember. \"He wanted to have a farm, sometime, I know.\""," \"All right. Thanks.\" Kramer touched the switch. \"When I get back to Terra maybe I'll stop and see you.\""," \"Let me know how it works out.\""," He cut the line and the picture dimmed and faded. He walked slowly back to where Gross and some officers of the Military were sitting at a chart table, talking."," \"Any luck?\" Gross said, looking up."," \"No. All she remembers is that he kept a goat.\""," \"Come over and look at this detail chart.\" Gross motioned him around to his side. \"Watch!\""," Kramer saw the record tabs moving furiously, the little white dots racing back and forth."," \"What's happening?\" he asked."," \"A squadron outside the defense zone has finally managed to contact the ship. They're maneuvering now, for position. Watch.\""," The white counters were forming a barrel formation around a black dot that was moving steadily across the board, away from the central position. As they watched, the white dots constricted around it."," \"They're ready to open fire,\" a technician at the board said. \"Commander, what shall we tell them to do?\""," Gross hesitated. \"I hate to be the one who makes the decision. When it comes right down to it--\""," \"It's not just a ship,\" Kramer said. \"It's a man, a living person. A human being is up there, moving through space. I wish we knew what--\""," \"But the order has to be given. We can't take any chances. Suppose he went over to them, to the yuks.\""," Kramer's jaw dropped. \"My God, he wouldn't do that.\""," \"Are you sure? Do you know what he'll do?\""," \"He wouldn't do that.\""," Gross turned to the technician. \"Tell them to go ahead.\""," \"I'm sorry, sir, but now the ship has gotten away. Look down at the board.\""," *****"," Gross stared down, Kramer over his shoulder. The black dot had slipped through the white dots and had moved off at an abrupt angle. The white dots were broken up, dispersing in confusion."," \"He's an unusual strategist,\" one of the officers said. He traced the line. \"It's an ancient maneuver, an old Prussian device, but it worked.\""," The white dots were turning back. \"Too many yuk ships out that far,\" Gross said. \"Well, that's what you get when you don't act quickly.\" He looked up coldly at Kramer. \"We should have done it when we had him. Look at him go!\" He jabbed a finger at the rapidly moving black dot. The dot came to the edge of the board and stopped. It had reached the limit of the chartered area. \"See?\""," --Now what? Kramer thought, watching. So the Old Man had escaped the cruisers and gotten away. He was alert, all right; there was nothing wrong with his mind. Or with his ability to control his new body."," Body--The ship was a new body for him. He had traded in the old dying body, withered and frail, for this hulking frame of metal and plastic, turbines and rocket jets. He was strong, now. Strong and big. The new body was more powerful than a thousand human bodies. But how long would it last him? The average life of a cruiser was only ten years. With careful handling he might get twenty out of it, before some essential part failed and there was no way to replace it."," And then, what then? What would he do, when something failed and there was no one to fix it for him? That would be the end. Someplace, far out in the cold darkness of space, the ship would slow down, silent and lifeless, to exhaust its last heat into the eternal timelessness of outer space. Or perhaps it would crash on some barren asteroid, burst into a million fragments."," It was only a question of time."," \"Your wife didn't remember anything?\" Gross said."," \"I told you. Only that he kept a goat, once.\""," \"A hell of a lot of help that is.\""," Kramer shrugged. \"It's not my fault.\""," \"I wonder if we'll ever see him again.\" Gross stared down at the indicator dot, still hanging at the edge of the board. \"I wonder if he'll ever move back this way.\""," \"I wonder, too,\" Kramer said."," *****"," That night Kramer lay in bed, tossing from side to side, unable to sleep. The moon gravity, even artificially increased, was unfamiliar to him and it made him uncomfortable. A thousand thoughts wandered loose in his head as he lay, fully awake."," What did it all mean? What was the Professor's plan? Maybe they would never know. Maybe the ship was gone for good; the Old Man had left forever, shooting into outer space. They might never find out why he had done it, what purpose--if any--had been in his mind."," Kramer sat up in bed. He turned on the light and lit a cigarette. His quarters were small, a metal-lined bunk room, part of the moon station base."," The Old Man had wanted to talk to him. He had wanted to discuss things, hold a conversation, but in the hysteria and confusion all they had been able to think of was getting away. The ship was rushing off with them, carrying them into outer space. Kramer set his jaw. Could they be blamed for jumping? They had no idea where they were being taken, or why. They were helpless, caught in their own ship, and the pursuit ship standing by waiting to pick them up was their only chance. Another half hour and it would have been too late."," But what had the Old Man wanted to say? What had he intended to tell him, in those first confusing moments when the ship around them had come alive, each metal strut and wire suddenly animate, the body of a living creature, a vast metal organism?"," It was weird, unnerving. He could not forget it, even now. He looked around the small room uneasily. What did it signify, the coming to life of metal and plastic? All at once they had found themselves inside a living creature, in its stomach, like Jonah inside the whale."," It had been alive, and it had talked to them, talked calmly and rationally, as it rushed them off, faster and faster into outer space. The wall speaker and circuit had become the vocal cords and mouth, the wiring the spinal cord and nerves, the hatches and relays and circuit breakers the muscles."," They had been helpless, completely helpless. The ship had, in a brief second, stolen their power away from them and left them defenseless, practically at its mercy. It was not right; it made him uneasy. All his life he had controlled machines, bent nature and the forces of nature to man and man's needs. The human race had slowly evolved until it was in a position to operate things, run them as it saw fit. Now all at once it had been plunged back down the ladder again, prostrate before a Power against which they were children."," Kramer got out of bed. He put on his bathrobe and began to search for a cigarette. While he was searching, the vidphone rang."," He snapped the vidphone on."," \"Yes?\""," The face of the immediate monitor appeared. \"A call from Terra, Mr. Kramer. An emergency call.\""," \"Emergency call? For me? Put it through.\" Kramer came awake, brushing his hair back out of his eyes. Alarm plucked at him."," From the speaker a strange voice came. \"Philip Kramer? Is this Kramer?\""," \"Yes. Go on.\""," \"This is General Hospital, New York City, Terra. Mr. Kramer, your wife is here. She has been critically injured in an accident. Your name was given to us to call. Is it possible for you to--\""," \"How badly?\" Kramer gripped the vidphone stand. \"Is it serious?\""," \"Yes, it's serious, Mr. Kramer. Are you able to come here? The quicker you can come the better.\""," \"Yes.\" Kramer nodded. \"I'll come. Thanks.\""," *****"," The screen died as the connection was broken. Kramer waited a moment. Then he tapped the button. The screen relit again. \"Yes, sir,\" the monitor said."," \"Can I get a ship to Terra at once? It's an emergency. My wife--\""," \"There's no ship leaving the moon for eight hours. You'll have to wait until the next period.\""," \"Isn't there anything I can do?\""," \"We can broadcast a general request to all ships passing through this area. Sometimes cruisers pass by here returning to Terra for repairs.\""," \"Will you broadcast that for me? I'll come down to the field.\""," \"Yes sir. But there may be no ship in the area for awhile. It's a gamble.\" The screen died."," Kramer dressed quickly. He put on his coat and hurried to the lift. A moment later he was running across the general receiving lobby, past the rows of vacant desks and conference tables. At the door the sentries stepped aside and he went outside, onto the great concrete steps."," The face of the moon was in shadow. Below him the field stretched out in total darkness, a black void, endless, without form. He made his way carefully down the steps and along the ramp along the side of the field, to the control tower. A faint row of red lights showed him the way."," Two soldiers challenged him at the foot of the tower, standing in the shadows, their guns ready."," \"Kramer?\""," \"Yes.\" A light was flashed in his face."," \"Your call has been sent out already.\""," \"Any luck?\" Kramer asked."," \"There's a cruiser nearby that has made contact with us. It has an injured jet and is moving slowly back toward Terra, away from the line.\""," \"Good.\" Kramer nodded, a flood of relief rushing through him. He lit a cigarette and gave one to each of the soldiers. The soldiers lit up."," \"Sir,\" one of them asked, \"is it true about the experimental ship?\""," \"What do you mean?\""," \"It came to life and ran off?\""," \"No, not exactly,\" Kramer said. \"It had a new type of control system instead of the Johnson units. It wasn't properly tested.\""," \"But sir, one of the cruisers that was there got up close to it, and a buddy of mine says this ship acted funny. He never saw anything like it. It was like when he was fishing once on Terra, in Washington State, fishing for bass. The fish were smart, going this way and that--\""," \"Here's your cruiser,\" the other soldier said. \"Look!\""," An enormous vague shape was setting slowly down onto the field. They could make nothing out but its row of tiny green blinkers. Kramer stared at the shape."," \"Better hurry, sir,\" the soldiers said. \"They don't stick around here very long.\""," \"Thanks.\" Kramer loped across the field, toward the black shape that rose up above him, extended across the width of the field. The ramp was down from the side of the cruiser and he caught hold of it. The ramp rose, and a moment later Kramer was inside the hold of the ship. The hatch slid shut behind him."," As he made his way up the stairs to the main deck the turbines roared up from the moon, out into space."," Kramer opened the door to the main deck. He stopped suddenly, staring around him in surprise. There was nobody in sight. The ship was deserted."," \"Good God,\" he said. Realization swept over him, numbing him. He sat down on a bench, his head swimming. \"Good God.\""," The ship roared out into space leaving the moon and Terra farther behind each moment."," And there was nothing he could do."," *****"," \"So it was you who put the call through,\" he said at last. \"It was you who called me on the vidphone, not any hospital on Terra. It was all part of the plan.\" He looked up and around him. \"And Dolores is really--\""," \"Your wife is fine,\" the wall speaker above him said tonelessly. \"It was a fraud. I am sorry to trick you that way, Philip, but it was all I could think of. Another day and you would have been back on Terra. I don't want to remain in this area any longer than necessary. They have been so certain of finding me out in deep space that I have been able to stay here without too much danger. But even the purloined letter was found eventually.\""," Kramer smoked his cigarette nervously. \"What are you going to do? Where are we going?\""," \"First, I want to talk to you. I have many things to discuss. I was very disappointed when you left me, along with the others. I had hoped that you would remain.\" The dry voice chuckled. \"Remember how we used to talk in the old days, you and I? That was a long time ago.\""," The ship was gaining speed. It plunged through space at tremendous speed, rushing through the last of the defense zone and out beyond. A rush of nausea made Kramer bend over for a moment."," When he straightened up the voice from the wall went on, \"I'm sorry to step it up so quickly, but we are still in danger. Another few moments and we'll be free.\""," \"How about yuk ships? Aren't they out here?\""," \"I've already slipped away from several of them. They're quite curious about me.\""," \"Curious?\""," \"They sense that I'm different, more like their own organic mines. They don't like it. I believe they will begin to withdraw from this area, soon. Apparently they don't want to get involved with me. They're an odd race, Philip. I would have liked to study them closely, try to learn something about them. I'm of the opinion that they use no inert material. All their equipment and instruments are alive, in some form or other. They don't construct or build at all. The idea of making is foreign to them. They utilize existing forms. Even their ships--\""," \"Where are we going?\" Kramer said. \"I want to know where you are taking me.\""," \"Frankly, I'm not certain.\""," \"You're not certain?\""," \"I haven't worked some details out. There are a few vague spots in my program, still. But I think that in a short while I'll have them ironed out.\""," \"What is your program?\" Kramer said."," \"It's really very simple. But don't you want to come into the control room and sit? The seats are much more comfortable than that metal bench.\""," Kramer went into the control room and sat down at the control board. Looking at the useless apparatus made him feel strange."," \"What's the matter?\" the speaker above the board rasped."," *****"," Kramer gestured helplessly. \"I'm--powerless. I can't do anything. And I don't like it. Do you blame me?\""," \"No. No, I don't blame you. But you'll get your control back, soon. Don't worry. This is only a temporary expedient, taking you off this way. It was something I didn't contemplate. I forgot that orders would be given out to shoot me on sight.\""," \"It was Gross' idea.\""," \"I don't doubt that. My conception, my plan, came to me as soon as you began to describe your project, that day at my house. I saw at once that you were wrong; you people have no understanding of the mind at all. I realized that the transfer of a human brain from an organic body to a complex artificial space ship would not involve the loss of the intellectualization faculty of the mind. When a man thinks, he is."," \"When I realized that, I saw the possibility of an age-old dream becoming real. I was quite elderly when I first met you, Philip. Even then my life-span had come pretty much to its end. I could look ahead to nothing but death, and with it the extinction of all my ideas. I had made no mark on the world, none at all. My students, one by one, passed from me into the world, to take up jobs in the great Research Project, the search for better and bigger weapons of war."," \"The world has been fighting for a long time, first with itself, then with the Martians, then with these beings from Proxima Centauri, whom we know nothing about. The human society has evolved war as a cultural institution, like the science of astronomy, or mathematics. War is a part of our lives, a career, a respected vocation. Bright, alert young men and women move into it, putting their shoulders to the wheel as they did in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. It has always been so."," \"But is it innate in mankind? I don't think so. No social custom is innate. There were many human groups that did not go to war; the Eskimos never grasped the idea at all, and the American Indians never took to it well."," \"But these dissenters were wiped out, and a cultural pattern was established that became the standard for the whole planet. Now it has become ingrained in us."," \"But if someplace along the line some other way of settling problems had arisen and taken hold, something different than the massing of men and material to--\""," \"What's your plan?\" Kramer said. \"I know the theory. It was part of one of your lectures.\""," \"Yes, buried in a lecture on plant selection, as I recall. When you came to me with this proposition I realized that perhaps my conception could be brought to life, after all. If my theory were right that war is only a habit, not an instinct, a society built up apart from Terra with a minimum of cultural roots might develop differently. If it failed to absorb our outlook, if it could start out on another foot, it might not arrive at the same point to which we have come: a dead end, with nothing but greater and greater wars in sight, until nothing is left but ruin and destruction everywhere."," \"Of course, there would have to be a Watcher to guide the experiment, at first. A crisis would undoubtedly come very quickly, probably in the second generation. Cain would arise almost at once."," \"You see, Kramer, I estimate that if I remain at rest most of the time, on some small planet or moon, I may be able to keep functioning for almost a hundred years. That would be time enough, sufficient to see the direction of the new colony. After that--Well, after that it would be up to the colony itself."," \"Which is just as well, of course. Man must take control eventually, on his own. One hundred years, and after that they will have control of their own destiny. Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps war is more than a habit. Perhaps it is a law of the universe, that things can only survive as groups by group violence."," \"But I'm going ahead and taking the chance that it is only a habit, that I'm right, that war is something we're so accustomed to that we don't realize it is a very unnatural thing. Now as to the place! I'm still a little vague about that. We must find the place, still."," \"That's what we're doing now. You and I are going to inspect a few systems off the beaten path, planets where the trading prospects are low enough to keep Terran ships away. I know of one planet that might be a good place. It was reported by the Fairchild Expedition in their original manual. We may look into that, for a start.\""," The ship was silent."," *****"," Kramer sat for a time, staring down at the metal floor under him. The floor throbbed dully with the motion of the turbines. At last he looked up."," \"You might be right. Maybe our outlook is only a habit.\" Kramer got to his feet. \"But I wonder if something has occurred to you?\""," \"What is that?\""," \"If it's such a deeply ingrained habit, going back thousands of years, how are you going to get your colonists to make the break, leave Terra and Terran customs? How about this generation, the first ones, the people who found the colony? I think you're right that the next generation would be free of all this, if there were an--\" He grinned. \"--An Old Man Above to teach them something else instead.\""," Kramer looked up at the wall speaker. \"How are you going to get the people to leave Terra and come with you, if by your own theory, this generation can't be saved, it all has to start with the next?\""," The wall speaker was silent. Then it made a sound, the faint dry chuckle."," \"I'm surprised at you, Philip. Settlers can be found. We won't need many, just a few.\" The speaker chuckled again. \"I'll acquaint you with my solution.\""," At the far end of the corridor a door slid open. There was sound, a hesitant sound. Kramer turned."," \"Dolores!\""," Dolores Kramer stood uncertainly, looking into the control room. She blinked in amazement. \"Phil! What are you doing here? What's going on?\""," They stared at each other."," \"What's happening?\" Dolores said. \"I received a vidcall that you had been hurt in a lunar explosion--\""," The wall speaker rasped into life. \"You see, Philip, that problem is already solved. We don't really need so many people; even a single couple might do.\""," Kramer nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he murmured thickly. \"Just one couple. One man and woman.\""," \"They might make it all right, if there were someone to watch and see that things went as they should. There will be quite a few things I can help you with, Philip. Quite a few. We'll get along very well, I think.\""," Kramer grinned wryly. \"You could even help us name the animals,\" he said. \"I understand that's the first step.\""," \"I'll be glad to,\" the toneless, impersonal voice said. \"As I recall, my part will be to bring them to you, one by one. Then you can do the actual naming.\""," \"I don't understand,\" Dolores faltered. \"What does he mean, Phil? Naming animals. What kind of animals? Where are we going?\""," Kramer walked slowly over to the port and stood staring silently out, his arms folded. Beyond the ship a myriad fragments of light gleamed, countless coals glowing in the dark void. Stars, suns, systems. Endless, without number. A universe of worlds. An infinity of planets, waiting for them, gleaming and winking from the darkness."," He turned back, away from the port. \"Where are we going?\" He smiled at his wife, standing nervous and frightened, her large eyes full of alarm. \"I don't know where we are going,\" he said. \"But somehow that doesn't seem too important right now.... I'm beginning to see the Professor's point, it's the result that counts.\""," And for the first time in many months he put his arm around Dolores. At first she stiffened, the fright and nervousness still in her eyes. But then suddenly she relaxed against him and there were tears wetting her cheeks."," \"Phil ... do you really think we can start over again--you and I?\""," He kissed her tenderly, then passionately."," And the spaceship shot swiftly through the endless, trackless eternity of the void...."," "," "],"excerpt":"A human brain-controlled spacecraft would mean mechanical perfection.

The tapping came again, louder and more imperative. It could not be ignored."," \"Darn!\" Lori said, throwing her book down on the coffee table and hurrying to the window. She grasped the heavy brass handles and lifted."," For a moment the window resisted. Then, with a protesting groan, it reluctantly rose. Cold autumn air, rushed into the room. The bit of leaf ceased tapping and swirled against the woman's throat, dancing to the floor."," Lori picked the leaf up. It was old and brown. Her heart skipped a beat as she slipped the leaf into the pocket of her jeans. Against her loins the leaf cut and tingled, a little hard point piercing her smooth skin and sending exciting shudders up and down her spine. She stood at the open window a moment, sniffing the air. The air was full of the presence of trees and rocks, of great boulders and remote places. It was time--time to go again. She touched the leaf. She was wanted."," Quickly Lori left the big living-room, hurrying through the hall into the dining-room. The dining-room was empty. A few chords of laughter drifted from the kitchen. Lori pushed the kitchen door open. \"Steve?\""," Her husband and his father were siting around the kitchen table, smoking their cigars and drinking steaming black coffee. \"What is it?\" Steve demanded, frowning at his young wife. \"Ed and I are in the middle of business.\""," \"I--I want to ask you something.\""," The two men gazed at her, brown-haired Steven, his dark eyes full of the stubborn dignity of New England men, and his father, silent and withdrawn in her presence. Ed Patterson scarcely noticed her. He rustled through a sheaf of feed bills, his broad back turned toward her."," \"What is it?\" Steve demanded impatiently. \"What do you want? Can't it wait?\""," \"I have to go,\" Lori blurted."," \"Go where?\""," \"Outside.\" Anxiety flooded over her. \"This is the last time. I promise. I won't go again, after this. Okay?\" She tried to smile, but her heart was pounding too hard. \"Please let me, Steve.\""," \"Where does she go?\" Ed rumbled."," Steve grunted in annoyance. \"Up in the hills. Some old abandoned place up there.\""," Ed's gray eyes flickered. \"Abandoned farm?\""," \"Yes. You know it?\""," \"The old Rickley farm. Rickley moved away years ago. Couldn't get anything to grow, not up there. Ground's all rocks. Bad soil. A lot of clay and stones. The place is all overgrown, tumbled down.\""," \"What kind of farm was it?\""," \"Orchard. Fruit orchard. Never yielded a damn thing. Thin old trees. Waste of effort.\""," Steve looked at his pocket watch. \"You'll be back in time to fix dinner?\""," \"Yes!\" Lori moved toward the door. \"Then I can go?\""," Steve's face twisted as he made up his mind. Lori waited impatiently, scarcely breathing. She had never got used to Vermont men and their slow, deliberate way. Boston people were quite different. And her group had been more the college youths, dances and talk, and late laughter."," \"Why do you go up there?\" Steve grumbled."," \"Don't ask me, Steve. Just let me go. This is the last time.\" She writhed in agony. She clenched her fists. \"Please!\""," Steve looked out the window. The cold autumn wind swirled through the trees. \"All right. But it's going to snow. I don't see why you want to--\""," Lori ran to get her coat from the closet. \"I'll be back to fix dinner!\" she shouted joyfully. She hurried to the front porch buttoning her coat, her heart racing. Her cheeks were flushed a deep, excited red as she closed the door behind her, her blood pounding in her veins."," Cold wind whipped against her, rumpling her hair, plucking at her body. She took a deep breath of the wind and started down the steps."," She walked rapidly onto the field, toward the bleak line of hills beyond. Except for the wind there was no sound. She patted her pocket. The dry leaf broke and dug hungrily into her."," \"I'm coming &#x2026;\" she whispered, a little awed and frightened. \"I'm on my way &#x2026;\""," H","",""," After a time low mists began to blow about her. At the top of the ridge she halted, breathing deeply, looking back the way she had come."," A few drops of rain stirred the leaves around her. Again the wind moved through the great dead trees along the ridge. Lori turned and started on, her head down, hands in her coat pockets."," She was on a rocky field, overgrown with weeds and dead grass. After a time she came to a ruined fence, broken and rotting. She stepped over it. She passed a tumbled-down well, half filled with stones and earth."," Her heart beat quickly, fluttering with nervous excitement. She was almost there. She passed the remains of a building, sagging timbers and broken glass, a few ruined pieces of furniture strewn nearby. An old automobile tire caked and cracked. Some damp rags heaped over rusty, bent bed-springs."," And there it was--directly ahead."," Along the edge of the field was a grove of ancient trees. Lifeless trees, withered and dead, their thin, blackened stalks rising up leaflessly. Broken sticks stuck in the hard ground. Row after row of dead trees, some bent and leaning, torn loose from the rocky soil by the unending wind."," Lori crossed the field to the trees, her lungs laboring painfully. The wind surged against her without respite, whipping the foul-smelling mists into her nostrils and face. Her smooth skin was damp and shiny with the mist. She coughed and hurried on, stepping over the rocks and clods of earth, trembling with fear and anticipation."," She circled around the grove of trees, almost to the edge of the ridge. Carefully, she stepped among the sliding heaps of rocks. Then--"," She stopped, rigid. Her chest rose and fell with the effort of breathing. \"I came,\" she gasped."," For a long time she gazed at the withered old apple tree. She could not take her eyes from it. The sight of the ancient tree fascinated and repelled her. It was the only one alive, the only tree of all the grove still living. All the others were dead, dried-up. They had lost the struggle. But this tree still clung to life."," The tree was hard and barren. Only a few dark leaves hung from it--and some withered apples, dried and seasoned by wind and mists. They had stayed there, on the branches, forgotten and abandoned. The ground around the tree was cracked and bleak. Stones and decayed heaps of old leaves in ragged clumps."," \"I came,\" Lori said again. She took the leaf from her pocket and held it cautiously out. \"This tapped at the window. I knew when I heard it.\" She smiled mischievously, her red lips curling. \"It tapped and tapped, trying to get in. I ignored it. It was so--so impetuous. It annoyed me.\""," The tree swayed ominously. Its gnarled branches rubbed together. Something in the sound made Lori pull away. Terror rushed through her. She hurried back along the ridge, scrambling frantically out of reach."," \"Don't,\" she whispered. \"Please.\""," The wind ceased. The tree became silent. For a long time Lori watched it apprehensively."," Night was coming. The sky was darkening rapidly. A burst of frigid wind struck her, half turning her around. She shuddered, bracing herself against it, pulling her long coat around her. Far below, the floor of the valley was disappearing into shadow, into the vast cloud of night."," In the darkening mists the tree was stern and menacing, more ominous than usual. A few leaves blew from it, drifting and swirling with the wind. A leaf blew past her and she tried to catch it. The leaf escaped, dancing back toward the tree. Lori followed a little way and then stopped, gasping and laughing."," \"No,\" she said firmly, her hands on her hips. \"I won't.\""," There was silence. Suddenly the heaps of decayed leaves blew up in a furious circle around the tree. They quieted down, settling back."," \"No,\" Lori said. \"I'm not afraid of you. You can't hurt me.\" But her heart was hammering with fear. She moved back farther away."," The tree remained silent. Its wiry branches were motionless."," Lori regained her courage. \"This is the last time I can come,\" she said. \"Steve says I can't come any more. He doesn't like it.\""," She waited, but the tree did not respond."," \"They're sitting in the kitchen. The two of them. Smoking cigars and drinking coffee. Adding up feed bills.\" She wrinkled her nose.\" That's all they ever do. Add and subtract feed bills. Figure and figure. Profit and loss. Government taxes. Depreciation on the equipment.\""," The tree did not stir."," Lori shivered. A little more rain fell, big icy drops that slid down her cheeks, down the back of her neck and inside her heavy coat."," She moved closer to the tree. \"I won't be back. I won't see you again. This is the last time. I wanted to tell you. . . .\""," The tree moved. Its branches whipped into sudden life. Lori felt something hard and thin cut across her shoulder. Something caught her around the waist, tugging her forward."," She struggled desperately, trying to pull herself free. Suddenly the tree released her. She stumbled back, laughing and trembling with fear. \"No!\" she gasped. \"You can't have me!\" She hurried to the edge of the ridge. \"You'll never get me again. Understand? And I'm not afraid of you!\""," She stood, waiting and watching, trembling with cold and fear. Suddenly she turned and fled, down the side of the ridge, sliding and falling on the loose stones. Blind terror gripped her. She ran on and on, down the steep slope, grabbing at roots and weeds--"," Something rolled beside her shoe. Something small and hard. She bent down and picked it up."," It was a little dried apple."," Lori gazed back up the slope at the tree. The tree was almost lost in the swirling mists. It stood, jutting up against the black sky, a hard unmoving pillar."," Lori put the apple in her coat pocket and continued down the side of the hill. When she reached the floor of the valley she took the apple out of her pocket."," It was late. A deep hunger began to gnaw inside her. She thought suddenly of dinner, the warm kitchen, the white tablecloth. Steaming stew and biscuits."," As she walked she nibbled on the little apple."," L","",""," What had wakened her? Lori pushed her dark hair back out of her eyes, shaking her head. What--"," A spasm of pain burst loose inside her. She gasped and put her hand to her stomach. For a time she wrestled silently, jaws locked, swaying back and forth."," The pain went away. Lori sank back. She cried out, a faint, thin cry. \"Steve--\""," Steven stirred. He turned over a little, grunting in his sleep."," The pain came again. Harder. She fell forward on her face, writhing in agony. The pain ripped at her, tearing at her belly. She screamed, a shrill wail of fear and pain."," Steve sat up. \"For God's sake--\" He rubbed his eyes and snapped on the lamp. \"What the hell--\""," Lori lay on her side, gasping and moaning, her eyes staring, knotted fists pressed into her stomach. The pain twisted and seared, devouring her, eating into her."," \"Lori!\" Steven grated. \"What is it?\""," She screamed. Again and again. Until the house rocked with echoes. She slid from the bed, onto the floor, her body writhing and jerking, her face unrecognizable."," Ed came hurrying into the room, pulling his bathrobe around him. \"What's going on?\""," The two men stared helplessly down at the woman on the floor."," \"Good God,\" Ed said. He closed his eyes."," T","",""," \"I'll call you later,\" Doctor Blair said. \"There are certain particulars.\""," \"I know,\" Steve muttered. He was still dazed. His face was gray and puffy from lack of sleep."," \"I left some sedatives for you. Try to get a little rest.\""," \"You think,\" Steve asked suddenly, \"if we had called you earlier--\""," \"No.\" Blair glanced up at him sympathetically. \"I don't. In a thing like that, there's not much chance. Not after it's burst.\""," \"Then it was appendicitis?\""," Blair nodded. \"Yes.\""," \"If we hadn't been so damn far out,\" Steve said bitterly. \"stuck out in the country. No hospital. Nothing. Miles from town. And we didn't realize at first--\""," \"Well, it's over now.\" The upright Ford moved forward a little. All at once a thought came to the Doctor. \"One more thing.\""," \"What is it?\" Steve said dully."," Blair hesitated. \"Post mortems--very unfortunate. I don't think there's any reason for one in this case. I'm certain in my own mind. . . . But I wanted to ask--\""," \"What is it?\""," \"Is there anything the girl might have swallowed? Did she put things in her mouth? Needles--while she was sewing? Pins, coins, anything like that? Seeds? Did she ever eat watermelon? Sometimes the appendix--\""," \"No.\""," Steve shook his head wearily. \"I don't know.\""," \"It was just a thought.\" Doctor Blair drove slowly off down the narrow tree-lined street, leaving two dark streaks, two soiled lines that marred the pale, glistening snow."," S","",""," \"Stop here,\" Steve murmured."," Ed Patterson brought the car to a halt at the side of the street. He turned off the motor. The two men sat in silence, neither of them speaking."," At the end of the street children were playing. A high school boy was mowing a lawn, pushing the machine over the wet grass. The street was dark in the shade of the great trees growing along each side."," \"Nice,\" Ed said."," Steve nodded without answering. Moodily, he watched a young girl walking by, a shopping bag under her arm. The girl climbed the stairs of a porch and disappeared into an old-fashioned yellow house."," Steve pushed the car door open. \"Come on. Let's get it over with.\""," Ed lifted the wreath of flowers from the back seat and put them in his son's lap. \"You'll have to carry it. It's your job.\""," \"All right.\" Steve grabbed the flowers and stepped out onto the pavement."," The two men walked up the street together, silent and thoughtful."," \"It's been seven or eight months, now,\" Steve said abruptly."," \"At least.\" Ed lit the cigar as they walked along, puffing clouds of gray smoke around them. \"Maybe a little more.\""," \"I never should have brought her up here. She lived in town all her life. She didn't know anything about the country.\""," \"It would have happened anyhow.\""," \"If we had been closer to a hospital--\""," The doctor said it wouldn't have made any difference. Even if we'd called him right away instead of waiting until morning.\" They came to the corner and turned. \"And as you know--\""," \"Forget it,\" Steve said, suddenly tense."," The sounds of the children had fallen behind them. The houses had thinned out. Their footsteps rang out against the pavement as they walked along."," \"We're almost there,\" Steve said."," They came to a rise. Beyond the rise was a heavy brass fence, running the length of a small field. A green field, neat and even. With carefully placed plaques of white marble criss-crossing it."," \"Here we are,\" Steve said tightly."," \"They keep it nice.\""," \"Can we get in from this side?\""," \"We can try.\" Ed started along the brass fence, looking for a gate."," Suddenly Steve halted, grunting. He stared across the field, his face white. \"Look.\""," \"What is it?\" Ed took off his glasses to see. \"What you looking at?\""," \"I was right.\" Steve's voice was low and indistinct. \"I thought there was something. Last time we were here. . . . I saw. . . . You see it?\""," \"I'm not sure. I see the tree, if that's what you mean.\""," In the center of the neat green field the lime apple tree rose proudly. Its bright leaves sparkled in the warm sunlight. The young tree was strong and very healthy. It swayed confidently with the wind, its supple trunk moist with sweet spring sap."," \"They're red,\" Steve said softly. \"They're already red. How the hell can they be red? It's only April. How the hell can they be red so soon?\""," \"I don't know,\" Ed said. \"I don't know anything about apples. A strange chill moved through him. But graveyards always made him uncomfortable. \"Maybe we ought to go.\""," \"Her cheeks were that color,\" Steve said, his voice low. \"When she had been running. Remember?\""," The two men gazed uneasily at the little apple tree, its shiny red fruit glistening in the spring sunlight, branches moving gently with the wind."," \"I remember, all right,\" Ed said grimly. \"Come on.\" He took his son's arm insistently, the wreath of flowers forgotten. \"Come on, Steve.

It was from the Base Commander himself, made out in Cox's heavy scrawl: Doc, this is the lad I told you about. Talk to him and try to find out how he got this delusion. He's from the new Garrison, the new check-station on Asteroid Y-3, and we don't want anything to go wrong there. Especially a silly damn thing like this!"," Harris pushed the card aside and stared back up at the youth across the desk from him. The young man seemed ill at ease and appeared to be avoiding answering the question Harris had put to him. Harris frowned. Westerburg was a good-looking chap, actually handsome in his Patrol uniform, a shock of blond hair over one eye. He was tall, almost six feet, a fine healthy lad, just two years out of Training, according to the card. Born in Detroit. Had measles when he was nine. Interested in jet engines, tennis, and girls. Twenty-six years old."," \"Well, Corporal Westerburg,\" Doctor Harris said again. \"Why do you think you're a plant?\""," The Corporal looked up shyly. He cleared his throat. \"Sir, I am a plant, I don't just think so. I've been a plant for several days, now.\""," \"I see.\" The Doctor nodded. \"You mean that you weren't always a plant?\""," \"No, sir. I just became a plant recently.\""," \"And what were you before you became a plant?\""," \"Well, sir, I was just like the rest of you.\""," There was silence. Doctor Harris took up his pen and scratched a few lines, but nothing of importance came. A plant? And such a healthy-looking lad! Harris removed his steel-rimmed glasses and polished them with his handkerchief. He put them on again and leaned back in his chair. \"Care for a cigarette, Corporal?\""," \"No, sir.\""," The Doctor lit one himself, resting his arm on the edge of the chair. \"Corporal, you must realize that there are very few men who become plants, especially on such short notice. I have to admit you are the first person who has ever told me such a thing.\""," \"Yes, sir, I realize it's quite rare.\""," \"You can understand why I'm interested, then. When you say you're a plant, you mean you're not capable of mobility? Or do you mean you're a vegetable, as opposed to an animal? Or just what?\""," The Corporal looked away. \"I can't tell you any more,\" he murmured. \"I'm sorry, sir.\""," \"Well, would you mind telling me how you became a plant?\""," Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He stared down at the floor, then out the window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. \"I can't even tell you that, sir,\" he said."," \"You can't? Why not?\""," \"Because--because I promised not to.\""," *****"," The room was silent. Doctor Harris rose, too, and they both stood facing each other. Harris frowned, rubbing his jaw. \"Corporal, just who did you promise?\""," \"I can't even tell you that, sir. I'm sorry.\""," The Doctor considered this. At last he went to the door and opened it. \"All right, Corporal. You may go now. And thanks for your time.\""," \"I'm sorry I'm not more helpful.\" The Corporal went slowly out and Harris closed the door after him. Then he went across his office to the vidphone. He rang Commander Cox's letter. A moment later the beefy good-natured face of the Base Commander appeared."," \"Cox, this is Harris. I talked to him, all right. All I could get is the statement that he's a plant. What else is there? What kind of behavior pattern?\""," \"Well,\" Cox said, \"the first thing they noticed was that he wouldn't do any work. The Garrison Chief reported that this Westerburg would wander off outside the Garrison and just sit, all day long. Just sit.\""," \"In the sun?\""," \"Yes. Just sit in the sun. Then at nightfall he would come back in. When they asked why he wasn't working in the jet repair building he told them he had to be out in the sun. Then he said--\" Cox hesitated."," \"Yes? Said what?\""," \"He said that work was unnatural. That it was a waste of time. That the only worthwhile thing was to sit and contemplate--outside.\""," \"What then?\""," \"Then they asked him how he got that idea, and then he revealed to them that he had become a plant.\""," \"I'm going to have to talk to him again, I can see,\" Harris said. \"And he's applied for a permanent discharge from the Patrol? What reason did he give?\""," \"The same, that he's a plant now, and has no more interest in being a Patrolman. All he wants to do is sit in the sun. It's the damnedest thing I ever heard.\""," \"All right. I think I'll visit him in his quarters.\" Harris looked at his watch. \"I'll go over after dinner.\""," \"Good luck,\" Cox said gloomily. \"But who ever heard of a man turning into a plant? We told him it wasn't possible, but he just smiled at us.\""," \"I'll let you know how I make out,\" Harris said."," *****"," Harris walked slowly down the hall. It was after six; the evening meal was over. A dim concept was coming into his mind, but it was much too soon to be sure. He increased his pace, turning right at the end of the hall. Two nurses passed, hurrying by. Westerburg was quartered with a buddy, a man who had been injured in a jet blast and who was now almost recovered. Harris came to the dorm wing and stopped, checking the numbers on the doors."," \"Can I help you, sir?\" the robot attendant said, gliding up."," \"I'm looking for Corporal Westerburg's room.\""," \"Three doors to the right.\""," Harris went on. Asteroid Y-3 had only recently been garrisoned and staffed. It had become the primary check-point to halt and examine ships entering the system from outer space. The Garrison made sure that no dangerous bacteria, fungus, or what-not arrived to infect the system. A nice asteroid it was, warm, well-watered, with trees and lakes and lots of sunlight. And the most modern Garrison in the nine planets. He shook his head, coming to the third door. He stopped, raising his hand and knocking."," \"Who's there?\" sounded through the door."," \"I want to see Corporal Westerburg.\""," The door opened. A bovine youth with horn-rimmed glasses looked out, a book in his hand. \"Who are you?\""," \"Doctor Harris.\""," \"I'm sorry, sir. Corporal Westerburg is asleep.\""," \"Would he mind if I woke him up? I want very much to talk to him.\" Harris peered inside. He could see a neat room, with a desk, a rug and lamp, and two bunks. On one of the bunks was Westerburg, lying face up, his arms folded across his chest, his eyes tightly closed."," \"Sir,\" the bovine youth said, \"I'm afraid I can't wake him up for you, much as I'd like to.\""," \"You can't? Why not?\""," \"Sir, Corporal Westerburg won't wake up, not after the sun sets. He just won't. He can't be wakened.\""," \"Cataleptic? Really?\""," \"But in the morning, as soon as the sun comes up, he leaps out of bed and goes outside. Stays the whole day.\""," \"I see,\" the Doctor said. \"Well, thanks anyhow.\" He went back out into the hall and the door shut after him. \"There's more to this than I realized,\" he murmured. He went on back the way he had come."," *****"," It was a warm sunny day. The sky was almost free of clouds and a gentle wind moved through the cedars along the bank of the stream. There was a path leading from the hospital building down the slope to the stream. At the stream a small bridge led over to the other side, and a few patients were standing on the bridge, wrapped in their bathrobes, looking aimlessly down at the water."," It took Harris several minutes to find Westerburg. The youth was not with the other patients, near or around the bridge. He had gone farther down, past the cedar trees and out onto a strip of bright meadow, where poppies and grass grew everywhere. He was sitting on the stream bank, on a flat grey stone, leaning back and staring up, his mouth open a little. He did not notice the Doctor until Harris was almost beside him."," \"Hello,\" Harris said softly."," Westerburg opened his eyes, looking up. He smiled and got slowly to his feet, a graceful, flowing motion that was rather surprising for a man of his size. \"Hello, Doctor. What brings you out here?\""," \"Nothing. Thought I'd get some sun.\""," \"Here, you can share my rock.\" Westerburg moved over and Harris sat down gingerly, being careful not to catch his trousers on the sharp edges of the rock. He lit a cigarette and gazed silently down at the water. Beside him, Westerburg had resumed his strange position, leaning back, resting on his hands, staring up with his eyes shut tight."," \"Nice day,\" the Doctor said."," \"Yes.\""," \"Do you come here every day?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"You like it better out here than inside.\""," \"I can't stay inside,\" Westerburg said."," \"You can't? How do you mean, 'can't'?\""," \"You would die without air, wouldn't you?\" the Corporal said."," \"And you'd die without sunlight?\""," Westerburg nodded."," \"Corporal, may I ask you something? Do you plan to do this the rest of your life, sit out in the sun on a flat rock? Nothing else?\""," Westerburg nodded."," \"How about your job? You went to school for years to become a Patrolman. You wanted to enter the Patrol very badly. You were given a fine rating and a first-class position. How do you feel, giving all that up? You know, it won't be easy to get back in again. Do you realize that?\""," \"I realize it.\""," \"And you're really going to give it all up?\""," \"That's right.\""," *****"," Harris was silent for a while. At last he put his cigarette out and turned toward the youth. \"All right, let's say you give up your job and sit in the sun. Well, what happens, then? Someone else has to do the job instead of you. Isn't that true? The job has to be done, your job has to be done. And if you don't do it someone else has to.\""," \"I suppose so.\""," \"Westerburg, suppose everyone felt the way you do? Suppose everyone wanted to sit in the sun all day? What would happen? No one would check ships coming from outer space. Bacteria and toxic crystals would enter the system and cause mass death and suffering. Isn't that right?\""," \"If everyone felt the way I do they wouldn't be going into outer space.\""," \"But they have to. They have to trade, they have to get minerals and products and new plants.\""," \"Why?\""," \"To keep society going.\""," \"Why?\""," \"Well--\" Harris gestured. \"People couldn't live without society.\""," Westerburg said nothing to that. Harris watched him, but the youth did not answer."," \"Isn't that right?\" Harris said."," \"Perhaps. It's a peculiar business, Doctor. You know, I struggled for years to get through Training. I had to work and pay my own way. Washed dishes, worked in kitchens. Studied at night, learned, crammed, worked on and on. And you know what I think, now?\""," \"What?\""," \"I wish I'd become a plant earlier.\""," Doctor Harris stood up. \"Westerburg, when you come inside, will you stop off at my office? I want to give you a few tests, if you don't mind.\""," \"The shock box?\" Westerburg smiled. \"I knew that would be coming around. Sure, I don't mind.\""," Nettled, Harris left the rock, walking back up the bank a short distance. \"About three, Corporal?\""," The Corporal nodded."," Harris made his way up the hill, to the path, toward the hospital building. The whole thing was beginning to become more clear to him. A boy who had struggled all his life. Financial insecurity. Idealized goal, getting a Patrol assignment. Finally reached it, found the load too great. And on Asteroid Y-3 there was too much vegetation to look at all day. Primitive identification and projection on the flora of the asteroid. Concept of security involved in immobility and permanence. Unchanging forest."," He entered the building. A robot orderly stopped him almost at once. \"Sir, Commander Cox wants you urgently, on the vidphone.\""," \"Thanks.\" Harris strode to his office. He dialed Cox's letter and the Commander's face came presently into focus. \"Cox? This is Harris. I've been out talking to the boy. I'm beginning to get this lined up, now. I can see the pattern, too much load too long. Finally gets what he wants and the idealization shatters under the--\""," \"Harris!\" Cox barked. \"Shut up and listen. I just got a report from Y-3. They're sending an express rocket here. It's on the way.\""," \"An express rocket?\""," \"Five more cases like Westerburg. All say they're plants! The Garrison Chief is worried as hell. Says we must find out what it is or the Garrison will fall apart, right away. Do you get me, Harris? Find out what it is!\""," \"Yes, sir,\" Harris murmured. \"Yes, sir.\""," *****"," By the end of the week there were twenty cases, and all, of course, were from Asteroid Y-3."," Commander Cox and Harris stood together at the top of the hill, looking gloomily down at the stream below. Sixteen men and four women sat in the sun along the bank, none of them moving, none speaking. An hour had gone by since Cox and Harris appeared, and in all that time the twenty people below had not stirred."," \"I don't get it,\" Cox said, shaking his head. \"I just absolutely don't get it. Harris, is this the beginning of the end? Is everything going to start cracking around us? It gives me a hell of a strange feeling to see those people down there, basking away in the sun, just sitting and basking.\""," \"Who's that man there with the red hair?\""," \"That's Ulrich Deutsch. He was Second in Command at the Garrison. Now look at him! Sits and dozes with his mouth open and his eyes shut. A week ago that man was climbing, going right up to the top. When the Garrison Chief retires he was supposed to take over. Maybe another year, at the most. All his life he's been climbing to get up there.\""," \"And now he sits in the sun,\" Harris finished."," \"That woman. The brunette, with the short hair. Career woman. Head of the entire office staff of the Garrison. And the man beside her. Janitor. And that cute little gal there, with the bosom. Secretary, just out of school. All kinds. And I got a note this morning, three more coming in sometime today.\""," Harris nodded. \"The strange thing is--they really want to sit down there. They're completely rational; they could do something else, but they just don't care to.\""," \"Well?\" Cox said. \"What are you going to do? Have you found anything? We're counting on you. Let's hear it.\""," \"I couldn't get anything out of them directly,\" Harris said, \"but I've had some interesting results with the shock box. Let's go inside and I'll show you.\""," \"Fine,\" Cox turned and started toward the hospital. \"Show me anything you've got. This is serious. Now I know how Tiberius felt when Christianity showed up in high places.\""," *****"," Harris snapped off the light. The room was pitch black. \"I'll run this first reel for you. The subject is one of the best biologists stationed at the Garrison. Robert Bradshaw. He came in yesterday. I got a good run from the shock box because Bradshaw's mind is so highly differentiated. There's a lot of repressed material of a non-rational nature, more than usual.\""," He pressed a switch. The projector whirred, and on the far wall a three-dimensional image appeared in color, so real that it might have been the man himself. Robert Bradshaw was a man of fifty, heavy-set, with iron grey hair and a square jaw. He sat in the chair calmly, his hands resting on the arms, oblivious to the electrodes attached to his neck and wrist. \"There I go,\" Harris said. \"Watch.\""," His film-image appeared, approaching Bradshaw. \"Now, Mr. Bradshaw,\" his image said, \"this won't hurt you at all, and it'll help us a lot.\" The image rotated the controls on the shock box. Bradshaw stiffened, and his jaw set, but otherwise he gave no sign. The image of Harris regarded him for a time and then stepped away from the controls."," \"Can you hear me, Mr. Bradshaw?\" the image asked."," \"Yes.\""," \"What is your name?\""," \"Robert C. Bradshaw.\""," \"What is your position?\""," \"Chief Biologist at the check-station on Y-3.\""," \"Are you there now?\""," \"No, I'm back on Terra. In a hospital.\""," \"Why?\""," \"Because I admitted to the Garrison Chief that I had become a plant.\""," \"Is that true? That you are a plant.\""," \"Yes, in a non-biological sense. I retain the physiology of a human being, of course.\""," \"What do you mean, then, that you're a plant?\""," \"The reference is to attitudinal response, to Weltanschauung.\""," \"Go on.\""," \"It is possible for a warm-blooded animal, an upper primate, to adopt the psychology of a plant, to some extent.\""," \"Yes?\""," \"I refer to this.\""," \"And the others? They refer to this also?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"How did this occur, your adopting this attitude?\""," Bradshaw's image hesitated, the lips twisting. \"See?\" Harris said to Cox. \"Strong conflict. He wouldn't have gone on, if he had been fully conscious.\""," \"I--\""," \"Yes?\""," \"I was taught to become a plant.\""," The image of Harris showed surprise and interest. \"What do you mean, you were taught to become a plant?\""," \"They realized my problems and taught me to become a plant. Now I'm free from them, the problems.\""," \"Who? Who taught you?\""," \"The Pipers.\""," \"Who? The Pipers? Who are the Pipers?\""," There was no answer."," \"Mr. Bradshaw, who are the Pipers?\""," After a long, agonized pause, the heavy lips parted. \"They live in the woods....\""," Harris snapped off the projector, and the lights came on. He and Cox blinked. \"That was all I could get,\" Harris said. \"But I was lucky to get that. He wasn't supposed to tell, not at all. That was the thing they all promised not to do, tell who taught them to become plants. The Pipers who live in the woods, on Asteroid Y-3.\""," \"You got this story from all twenty?\""," \"No.\" Harris grimaced. \"Most of them put up too much fight. I couldn't even get this much from them.\""," Cox reflected. \"The Pipers. Well? What do you propose to do? Just wait around until you can get the full story? Is that your program?\""," \"No,\" Harris said. \"Not at all. I'm going to Y-3 and find out who the Pipers are, myself.\""," *****"," The small patrol ship made its landing with care and precision, its jets choking into final silence. The hatch slid back and Doctor Henry Harris found himself staring out at a field, a brown, sun-baked landing field. At the end of the field was a tall signal tower. Around the field on all sides were long grey buildings, the Garrison check-station itself. Not far off a huge Venusian cruiser was parked, a vast green hulk, like an enormous lime. The technicians from the station were swarming all over it, checking and examining each inch of it for lethal life-forms and poisons that might have attached themselves to the hull."," \"All out, sir,\" the pilot said."," Harris nodded. He took hold of his two suitcases and stepped carefully down. The ground was hot underfoot, and he blinked in the bright sunlight. Jupiter was in the sky, and the vast planet reflected considerable sunlight down onto the asteroid."," Harris started across the field, carrying his suitcases. A field attendant was already busy opening the storage compartment of the patrol ship, extracting his trunk. The attendant lowered the trunk into a waiting dolly and came after him, manipulating the little truck with bored skill."," As Harris came to the entrance of the signal tower the gate slid back and a man came forward, an older man, large and robust, with white hair and a steady walk."," \"How are you, Doctor?\" he said, holding his hand out. \"I'm Lawrence Watts, the Garrison Chief.\""," They shook hands. Watts smiled down at Harris. He was a huge old man, still regal and straight in his dark blue uniform, with his gold epaulets sparkling on his shoulders."," \"Have a good trip?\" Watts asked. \"Come on inside and I'll have a drink fixed for you. It gets hot around here, with the Big Mirror up there.\""," \"Jupiter?\" Harris followed him inside the building. The signal tower was cool and dark, a welcome relief. \"Why is the gravity so near Terra's? I expected to go flying off like a kangaroo. Is it artificial?\""," \"No. There's a dense core of some kind to the asteroid, some kind of metallic deposit. That's why we picked this asteroid out of all the others. It made the construction problem much simpler, and it also explains why the asteroid has natural air and water. Did you see the hills?\""," \"The hills?\""," \"When we get up higher in the tower we'll be able to see over the buildings. There's quite a natural park here, a regular little forest, complete with everything you'd want. Come in here, Harris. This is my office.\" The old man strode at quite a clip, around the corner and into a large, well-furnished apartment. \"Isn't this pleasant? I intend to make my last year here as amiable as possible.\" He frowned. \"Of course, with Deutsch gone, I may be here forever. Oh, well.\" He shrugged. \"Sit down, Harris.\""," \"Thanks.\" Harris took a chair, stretching his legs out. He watched Watts as he closed the door to the hall. \"By the way, any more cases come up?\""," \"Two more today,\" Watts was grim. \"Makes almost thirty, in all. We have three hundred men in this station. At the rate it's going--\""," \"Chief, you spoke about a forest on the asteroid. Do you allow the crew to go into the forest at will? Or do you restrict them to the buildings and grounds?\""," *****"," Watts rubbed his jaw. \"Well, it's a difficult situation, Harris. I have to let the men leave the grounds sometimes. They can see the forest from the buildings, and as long as you can see a nice place to stretch out and relax that does it. Once every ten days they have a full period of rest. Then they go out and fool around.\""," \"And then it happens?\""," \"Yes, I suppose so. But as long as they can see the forest they'll want to go. I can't help it.\""," \"I know. I'm not censuring you. Well, what's your theory? What happens to them out there? What do they do?\""," \"What happens? Once they get out there and take it easy for a while they don't want to come back and work. It's boondoggling. Playing hookey. They don't want to work, so off they go.\""," \"How about this business of their delusions?\""," Watts laughed good-naturedly. \"Listen, Harris. You know as well as I do that's a lot of poppycock. They're no more plants than you or I. They just don't want to work, that's all. When I was a cadet we had a few ways to make people work. I wish we could lay a few on their backs, like we used to.\""," \"You think this is simple goldbricking, then?\""," \"Don't you think it is?\""," \"No,\" Harris said. \"They really believe they're plants. I put them through the high-frequency shock treatment, the shock box. The whole nervous system is paralyzed, all inhibitions stopped cold. They tell the truth, then. And they said the same thing--and more.\""," Watts paced back and forth, his hands clasped behind his back. \"Harris, you're a doctor, and I suppose you know what you're talking about. But look at the situation here. We have a garrison, a good modern garrison. We're probably the most modern outfit in the system. Every new device and gadget is here that science can produce. Harris, this garrison is one vast machine. The men are parts, and each has his job, the Maintenance Crew, the Biologists, the Office Crew, the Managerial Staff."," \"Look what happens when one person steps away from his job. Everything else begins to creak. We can't service the bugs if no one services the machines. We can't order food to feed the crews if no one makes out reports, takes inventories. We can't direct any kind of activity if the Second in Command decides to go out and sit in the sun all day."," \"Thirty people, one tenth of the Garrison. But we can't run without them. The Garrison is built that way. If you take the supports out the whole building falls. No one can leave. We're all tied here, and these people know it. They know they have no right to do that, run off on their own. No one has that right anymore. We're all too tightly interwoven to suddenly start doing what we want. It's unfair to the rest, the majority.\""," *****"," Harris nodded. \"Chief, can I ask you something?\""," \"What is it?\""," \"Are there any inhabitants on the asteroid? Any natives?\""," \"Natives?\" Watts considered. \"Yes, there's some kind of aborigines living out there.\" He waved vaguely toward the window."," \"What are they like? Have you seen them?\""," \"Yes, I've seen them. At least, I saw them when we first came here. They hung around for a while, watching us, then after a time they disappeared.\""," \"Did they die off? Diseases of some kind?\""," \"No. They just--just disappeared. Into their forest. They're still there, someplace.\""," \"What kind of people are they?\""," \"Well, the story is that they're originally from Mars. They don't look much like Martians, though. They're dark, a kind of coppery color. Thin. Very agile, in their own way. They hunt and fish. No written language. We don't pay much attention to them.\""," \"I see.\" Harris paused. \"Chief, have you ever heard of anything called--The Pipers?\""," \"The Pipers?\" Watts frowned. \"No. Why?\""," \"The patients mentioned something called The Pipers. According to Bradshaw, the Pipers taught him to become a plant. He learned it from them, a kind of teaching.\""," \"The Pipers. What are they?\""," \"I don't know,\" Harris admitted. \"I thought maybe you might know. My first assumption, of course, was that they're the natives. But now I'm not so sure, not after hearing your description of them.\""," \"The natives are primitive savages. They don't have anything to teach anybody, especially a top-flight biologist.\""," Harris hesitated. \"Chief, I'd like to go into the woods and look around. Is that possible?\""," \"Certainly. I can arrange it for you. I'll give you one of the men to show you around.\""," \"I'd rather go alone. Is there any danger?\""," \"No, none that I know of. Except--\""," \"Except the Pipers,\" Harris finished. \"I know. Well, there's only one way to find them, and that's it. I'll have to take my chances.\""," *****"," \"If you walk in a straight line,\" Chief Watts said, \"you'll find yourself back at the Garrison in about six hours. It's a damn small asteroid. There's a couple of streams and lakes, so don't fall in.\""," \"How about snakes or poisonous insects?\""," \"Nothing like that reported. We did a lot of tramping around at first, but it's grown back now, the way it was. We never encountered anything dangerous.\""," \"Thanks, Chief,\" Harris said. They shook hands. \"I'll see you before nightfall.\""," \"Good luck.\" The Chief and his two armed escorts turned and went back across the rise, down the other side toward the Garrison. Harris watched them go until they disappeared inside the building. Then he turned and started into the grove of trees."," The woods were very silent around him as he walked. Trees towered up on all sides of him, huge dark-green trees like eucalyptus. The ground underfoot was soft with endless leaves that had fallen and rotted into soil. After a while the grove of high trees fell behind and he found himself crossing a dry meadow, the grass and weeds burned brown in the sun. Insects buzzed around him, rising up from the dry weed-stalks. Something scuttled ahead, hurrying through the undergrowth. He caught sight of a grey ball with many legs, scampering furiously, its antennae weaving."," The meadow ended at the bottom of a hill. He was going up, now, going higher and higher. Ahead of him an endless expanse of green rose, acres of wild growth. He scrambled to the top finally, blowing and panting, catching his breath."," He went on. Now he was going down again, plunging into a deep gully. Tall ferns grew, as large as trees. He was entering a living Jurassic forest, ferns that stretched out endlessly ahead of him. Down he went, walking carefully. The air began to turn cold around him. The floor of the gully was damp and silent; underfoot the ground was almost wet."," He came out on a level table. It was dark, with the ferns growing up on all sides, dense growths of ferns, silent and unmoving. He came upon a natural path, an old stream bed, rough and rocky, but easy to follow. The air was thick and oppressive. Beyond the ferns he could see the side of the next hill, a green field rising up."," Something grey was ahead. Rocks, piled-up boulders, scattered and stacked here and there. The stream bed led directly to them. Apparently this had been a pool of some kind, a stream emptying from it. He climbed the first of the boulders awkwardly, feeling his way up. At the top he paused, resting again."," As yet he had had no luck. So far he had not met any of the natives. It would be through them that he would find the mysterious Pipers that were stealing the men away, if such really existed. If he could find the natives, talk to them, perhaps he could find out something. But as yet he had been unsuccessful. He looked around. The woods were very silent. A slight breeze moved through the ferns, rustling them, but that was all. Where were the natives? Probably they had a settlement of some sort, huts, a clearing. The asteroid was small; he should be able to find them by nightfall."," *****"," He started down the rocks. More rocks rose up ahead and he climbed them. Suddenly he stopped, listening. Far off, he could hear a sound, the sound of water. Was he approaching a pool of some kind? He went on again, trying to locate the sound. He scrambled down rocks and up rocks, and all around him there was silence, except for the splashing of distant water. Maybe a waterfall, water in motion. A stream. If he found the stream he might find the natives."," The rocks ended and the stream bed began again, but this time it was wet, the bottom muddy and overgrown with moss. He was on the right track; not too long ago this stream had flowed, probably during the rainy season. He went up on the side of the stream, pushing through the ferns and vines. A golden snake slid expertly out of his path. Something glinted ahead, something sparkling through the ferns. Water. A pool. He hurried, pushing the vines aside and stepping out, leaving them behind."," He was standing on the edge of a pool, a deep pool sunk in a hollow of grey rocks, surrounded by ferns and vines. The water was clear and bright, and in motion, flowing in a waterfall at the far end. It was beautiful, and he stood watching, marveling at it, the undisturbed quality of it. Untouched, it was. Just as it had always been, probably. As long as the asteroid existed. Was he the first to see it? Perhaps. It was so hidden, so concealed by the ferns. It gave him a strange feeling, a feeling almost of ownership. He stepped down a little toward the water."," And it was then he noticed her."," The girl was sitting on the far edge of the pool, staring down into the water, resting her head on one drawn-up knee. She had been bathing; he could see that at once. Her coppery body was still wet and glistening with moisture, sparkling in the sun. She had not seen him. He stopped, holding his breath, watching her."," She was lovely, very lovely, with long dark hair that wound around her shoulders and arms. Her body was slim, very slender, with a supple grace to it that made him stare, accustomed as he was to various forms of anatomy. How silent she was! Silent and unmoving, staring down at the water. Time passed, strange, unchanging time, as he watched the girl. Time might even have ceased, with the girl sitting on the rock staring into the water, and the rows of great ferns behind her, as rigid as if they had been painted there."," All at once the girl looked up. Harris shifted, suddenly conscious of himself as an intruder. He stepped back. \"I'm sorry,\" he murmured. \"I'm from the Garrison. I didn't mean to come poking around.\""," She nodded without speaking."," \"You don't mind?\" Harris asked presently."," \"No.\""," So she spoke Terran! He moved a little toward her, around the side of the pool. \"I hope you don't mind my bothering you. I won't be on the asteroid very long. This is my first day here. I just arrived from Terra.\""," She smiled faintly."," \"I'm a doctor. Henry Harris.\" He looked down at her, at the slim coppery body, gleaming in the sunlight, a faint sheen of moisture on her arms and thighs. \"You might be interested in why I'm here.\" He paused. \"Maybe you can even help me.\""," She looked up a little. \"Oh?\""," \"Would you like to help me?\""," She smiled. \"Yes. Of course.\""," \"That's good. Mind if I sit down?\" He looked around and found himself a flat rock. He sat down slowly, facing her. \"Cigarette?\""," \"No.\""," \"Well, I'll have one.\" He lit up, taking a deep breath. \"You see, we have a problem at the Garrison. Something has been happening to some of the men, and it seems to be spreading. We have to find out what causes it or we won't be able to run the Garrison.\""," *****"," He waited for a moment. She nodded slightly. How silent she was! Silent and unmoving. Like the ferns."," \"Well, I've been able to find out a few things from them, and one very interesting fact stands out. They keep saying that something called--called The Pipers are responsible for their condition. They say the Pipers taught them--\" He stopped. A strange look had flitted across her dark, small face. \"Do you know the Pipers?\""," She nodded."," Acute satisfaction flooded over Harris. \"You do? I was sure the natives would know.\" He stood up again. \"I was sure they would, if the Pipers really existed. Then they do exist, do they?\""," \"They exist.\""," Harris frowned. \"And they're here, in the woods?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"I see.\" He ground his cigarette out impatiently. \"You don't suppose there's any chance you could take me to them, do you?\""," \"Take you?\""," \"Yes. I have this problem and I have to solve it. You see, the Base Commander on Terra has assigned this to me, this business about the Pipers. It has to be solved. And I'm the one assigned to the job. So it's important to me to find them. Do you see? Do you understand?\""," She nodded."," \"Well, will you take me to them?\""," The girl was silent. For a long time she sat, staring down into the water, resting her head against her knee. Harris began to become impatient. He fidgeted back and forth, resting first on one leg and then on the other."," \"Well, will you?\" he said again. \"It's important to the whole Garrison. What do you say?\" He felt around in his pockets. \"Maybe I could give you something. What do I have....\" He brought out his lighter. \"I could give you my lighter.\""," The girl stood up, rising slowly, gracefully, without motion or effort. Harris' mouth fell open. How supple she was, gliding to her feet in a single motion! He blinked. Without effort she had stood, seemingly without change. All at once she was standing instead of sitting, standing and looking calmly at him, her small face expressionless."," \"Will you?\" he said."," \"Yes. Come along.\" She turned away, moving toward the row of ferns."," Harris followed quickly, stumbling across the rocks. \"Fine,\" he said. \"Thanks a lot. I'm very interested to meet these Pipers. Where are you taking me, to your village? How much time do we have before nightfall?\""," The girl did not answer. She had entered the ferns already, and Harris quickened his pace to keep from losing her. How silently she glided!"," \"Wait,\" he called. \"Wait for me.\""," The girl paused, waiting for him, slim and lovely, looking silently back."," He entered the ferns, hurrying after her."," *****"," \"Well, I'll be damned!\" Commander Cox said. \"It sure didn't take you long.\" He leaped down the steps two at a time. \"Let me give you a hand.\""," Harris grinned, lugging his heavy suitcases. He set them down and breathed a sigh of relief. \"It isn't worth it,\" he said. \"I'm going to give up taking so much.\""," \"Come on inside. Soldier, give him a hand.\" A Patrolman hurried over and took one of the suitcases. The three men went inside and down the corridor to Harris' quarters. Harris unlocked the door and the Patrolman deposited his suitcase inside."," \"Thanks,\" Harris said. He set the other down beside it. \"It's good to be back, even for a little while.\""," \"A little while?\""," \"I just came back to settle my affairs. I have to return to Y-3 tomorrow morning.\""," \"Then you didn't solve the problem?\""," \"I solved it, but I haven't cured it. I'm going back and get to work right away. There's a lot to be done.\""," \"But you found out what it is?\""," \"Yes. It was just what the men said. The Pipers.\""," \"The Pipers do exist?\""," \"Yes.\" Harris nodded. \"They do exist.\" He removed his coat and put it over the back of the chair. Then he went to the window and let it down. Warm spring air rushed into the room. He settled himself on the bed, leaning back."," \"The Pipers exist, all right--in the minds of the Garrison crew! To the crew, the Pipers are real. The crew created them. It's a mass hypnosis, a group projection, and all the men there have it, to some degree.\""," \"How did it start?\""," \"Those men on Y-3 were sent there because they were skilled, highly-trained men with exceptional ability. All their lives they've been schooled by complex modern society, fast tempo and high integration between people. Constant pressure toward some goal, some job to be done."," \"Those men are put down suddenly on an asteroid where there are natives living the most primitive of existence, completely vegetable lives. No concept of goal, no concept of purpose, and hence no ability to plan. The natives live the way the animals live, from day to day, sleeping, picking food from the trees. A kind of Garden-of-Eden existence, without struggle or conflict.\""," \"So? But--\""," \"Each of the Garrison crew sees the natives and unconsciously thinks of his own early life, when he was a child, when he had no worries, no responsibilities, before he joined modern society. A baby lying in the sun."," \"But he can't admit this to himself! He can't admit that he might want to live like the natives, to lie and sleep all day. So he invents The Pipers, the idea of a mysterious group living in the woods who trap him, lead him into their kind of life. Then he can blame them, not himself. They 'teach' him to become a part of the woods.\""," \"What are you going to do? Have the woods burned?\""," \"No.\" Harris shook his head. \"That's not the answer; the woods are harmless. The answer is psychotherapy for the men. That's why I'm going right back, so I can begin work. They've got to be made to see that the Pipers are inside them, their own unconscious voices calling to them to give up their responsibilities. They've got to be made to realize that there are no Pipers, at least, not outside themselves. The woods are harmless and the natives have nothing to teach anyone. They're primitive savages, without even a written language. We're seeing a psychological projection by a whole Garrison of men who want to lay down their work and take it easy for a while.\""," The room was silent."," \"I see,\" Cox said presently. \"Well, it makes sense.\" He got to his feet. \"I hope you can do something with the men when you get back.\""," \"I hope so, too,\" Harris agreed. \"And I think I can. After all, it's just a question of increasing their self-awareness. When they have that the Pipers will vanish.\""," Cox nodded. \"Well, you go ahead with your unpacking, Doc. I'll see you at dinner. And maybe before you leave, tomorrow.\""," \"Fine.\""," *****"," Harris opened the door and the Commander went out into the hall. Harris closed the door after him and then went back across the room. He looked out the window for a moment, his hands in his pockets."," It was becoming evening, the air was turning cool. The sun was just setting as he watched, disappearing behind the buildings of the city surrounding the hospital. He watched it go down."," Then he went over to his two suitcases. He was tired, very tired from his trip. A great weariness was beginning to descend over him. There were so many things to do, so terribly many. How could he hope to do them all? Back to the asteroid. And then what?"," He yawned, his eyes closing. How sleepy he was! He looked over at the bed. Then he sat down on the edge of it and took his shoes off. So much to do, the next day."," He put his shoes in the corner of the room. Then he bent over, unsnapping one of the suitcases. He opened the suitcase. From it he took a bulging gunnysack. Carefully, he emptied the contents of the sack out on the floor. Dirt, rich soft dirt. Dirt he had collected during his last hours there, dirt he had carefully gathered up."," When the dirt was spread out on the floor he sat down in the middle of it. He stretched himself out, leaning back. When he was fully comfortable he folded his hands across his chest and closed his eyes. So much work to do--But later on, of course. Tomorrow.

The 1995 film Screamers was adapted from this story and it may have influenced the 1984 legendary movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Terminator."," The claws were bad enough in the first place--nasty, crawling little death-robots. But when they began to imitate their creators, it was time for the human race to make peace--if it could!","",""," The Russian soldier made his way nervously up the ragged side of the hill, holding his gun ready. He glanced around him, licking his dry lips, his face set. From time to time he reached up a gloved hand and wiped perspiration from his neck, pushing down his coat collar."," Eric turned to Corporal Leone. \"Want him? Or can I have him?\" He adjusted the view sight so the Russian's features squarely filled the glass, the lines cutting across his hard, somber features."," Leone considered. The Russian was close, moving rapidly, almost running. \"Don't fire. Wait.\" Leone tensed. \"I don't think we're needed.\""," The Russian increased his pace, kicking ash and piles of debris out of his way. He reached the top of the hill and stopped, panting, staring around him. The sky was overcast, drifting clouds of gray particles. Bare trunks of trees jutted up occasionally; the ground was level and bare, rubble-strewn, with the ruins of buildings standing out here and there like yellowing skulls."," The Russian was uneasy. He knew something was wrong. He started down the hill. Now he was only a few paces from the bunker. Eric was getting fidgety. He played with his pistol, glancing at Leone."," \"Don't worry,\" Leone said. \"He won't get here. They'll take care of him.\""," \"Are you sure? He's got damn far.\""," \"They hang around close to the bunker. He's getting into the bad part. Get set!\""," The Russian began to hurry, sliding down the hill, his boots sinking into the heaps of gray ash, trying to keep his gun up. He stopped for a moment, lifting his fieldglasses to his face."," \"He's looking right at us,\" Eric said."," *****"," The Russian came on. They could see his eyes, like two blue stones. His mouth was open a little. He needed a shave; his chin was stubbled. On one bony cheek was a square of tape, showing blue at the edge. A fungoid spot. His coat was muddy and torn. One glove was missing. As he ran his belt counter bounced up and down against him."," Leone touched Eric's arm. \"Here one comes.\""," Across the ground something small and metallic came, flashing in the dull sunlight of mid-day. A metal sphere. It raced up the hill after the Russian, its treads flying. It was small, one of the baby ones. Its claws were out, two razor projections spinning in a blur of white steel. The Russian heard it. He turned instantly, firing. The sphere dissolved into particles. But already a second had emerged and was following the first. The Russian fired again."," A third sphere leaped up the Russian's leg, clicking and whirring. It jumped to the shoulder. The spinning blades disappeared into the Russian's throat."," Eric relaxed. \"Well, that's that. God, those damn things give me the creeps. Sometimes I think we were better off before.\""," \"If we hadn't invented them, they would have.\" Leone lit a cigarette shakily. \"I wonder why a Russian would come all this way alone. I didn't see anyone covering him.\""," Lt. Scott came slipping up the tunnel, into the bunker. \"What happened? Something entered the screen.\""," \"An Ivan.\""," \"Just one?\""," Eric brought the view screen around. Scott peered into it. Now there were numerous metal spheres crawling over the prostrate body, dull metal globes clicking and whirring, sawing up the Russian into small parts to be carried away."," \"What a lot of claws,\" Scott murmured."," \"They come like flies. Not much game for them any more.\""," Scott pushed the sight away, disgusted. \"Like flies. I wonder why he was out there. They know we have claws all around.\""," A larger robot had joined the smaller spheres. It was directing operations, a long blunt tube with projecting eyepieces. There was not much left of the soldier. What remained was being brought down the hillside by the host of claws."," \"Sir,\" Leone said. \"If it's all right, I'd like to go out there and take a look at him.\""," \"Why?\""," \"Maybe he came with something.\""," Scott considered. He shrugged. \"All right. But be careful.\""," \"I have my tab.\" Leone patted the metal band at his wrist. \"I'll be out of bounds.\""," *****"," He picked up his rifle and stepped carefully up to the mouth of the bunker, making his way between blocks of concrete and steel prongs, twisted and bent. The air was cold at the top. He crossed over the ground toward the remains of the soldier, striding across the soft ash. A wind blew around him, swirling gray particles up in his face. He squinted and pushed on."," The claws retreated as he came close, some of them stiffening into immobility. He touched his tab. The Ivan would have given something for that! Short hard radiation emitted from the tab neutralized the claws, put them out of commission. Even the big robot with its two waving eyestalks retreated respectfully as he approached."," He bent down over the remains of the soldier. The gloved hand was closed tightly. There was something in it. Leone pried the fingers apart. A sealed container, aluminum. Still shiny."," He put it in his pocket and made his way back to the bunker. Behind him the claws came back to life, moving into operation again. The procession resumed, metal spheres moving through the gray ash with their loads. He could hear their treads scrabbling against the ground. He shuddered."," Scott watched intently as he brought the shiny tube out of his pocket. \"He had that?\""," \"In his hand.\" Leone unscrewed the top. \"Maybe you should look at it, sir.\""," Scott took it. He emptied the contents out in the palm of his hand. A small piece of silk paper, carefully folded. He sat down by the light and unfolded it."," \"What's it say, sir?\" Eric said. Several officers came up the tunnel. Major Hendricks appeared."," \"Major,\" Scott said. \"Look at this.\""," Hendricks read the slip. \"This just come?\""," \"A single runner. Just now.\""," \"Where is he?\" Hendricks asked sharply."," \"The claws got him.\""," Major Hendricks grunted. \"Here.\" He passed it to his companions. \"I think this is what we've been waiting for. They certainly took their time about it.\""," \"So they want to talk terms,\" Scott said. \"Are we going along with them?\""," \"That's not for us to decide.\" Hendricks sat down. \"Where's the communications officer? I want the Moon Base.\""," Leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside antenna cautiously, scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of a watching Russian ship."," \"Sir,\" Scott said to Hendricks. \"It's sure strange they suddenly came around. We've been using the claws for almost a year. Now all of a sudden they start to fold.\""," \"Maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers.\""," \"One of the big ones, the kind with stalks, got into an Ivan bunker last week,\" Eric said. \"It got a whole platoon of them before they got their lid shut.\""," \"How do you know?\""," \"A buddy told me. The thing came back with--with remains.\""," \"Moon Base, sir,\" the communications officer said."," On the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared. His crisp uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker. And he was clean shaven. \"Moon Base.\""," \"This is forward command L-Whistle. On Terra. Let me have General Thompson.\""," The monitor faded. Presently General Thompson's heavy features came into focus. \"What is it, Major?\""," \"Our claws got a single Russian runner with a message. We don't know whether to act on it--there have been tricks like this in the past.\""," \"What's the message?\""," \"The Russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to their lines. For a conference. They don't state the nature of the conference. They say that matters of--\" He consulted the slip. \"--Matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be opened between a representative of the UN forces and themselves.\""," He held the message up to the screen for the general to scan. Thompson's eyes moved."," \"What should we do?\" Hendricks said."," \"Send a man out.\""," \"You don't think it's a trap?\""," \"It might be. But the location they give for their forward command is correct. It's worth a try, at any rate.\""," \"I'll send an officer out. And report the results to you as soon as he returns.\""," \"All right, Major.\" Thompson broke the connection. The screen died. Up above, the antenna came slowly down."," Hendricks rolled up the paper, deep in thought."," \"I'll go,\" Leone said."," \"They want somebody at policy level.\" Hendricks rubbed his jaw. \"Policy level. I haven't been outside in months. Maybe I could use a little air.\""," \"Don't you think it's risky?\""," Hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it. The remains of the Russian were gone. Only a single claw was in sight. It was folding itself back, disappearing into the ash, like a crab. Like some hideous metal crab...."," \"That's the only thing that bothers me.\" Hendricks rubbed his wrist. \"I know I'm safe as long as I have this on me. But there's something about them. I hate the damn things. I wish we'd never invented them. There's something wrong with them. Relentless little--\""," \"If we hadn't invented them, the Ivans would have.\""," Hendricks pushed the sight back. \"Anyhow, it seems to be winning the war. I guess that's good.\""," \"Sounds like you're getting the same jitters as the Ivans.\" Hendricks examined his wrist watch. \"I guess I had better get started, if I want to be there before dark.\""," *****"," He took a deep breath and then stepped out onto the gray, rubbled ground. After a minute he lit a cigarette and stood gazing around him. The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles, endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray, drifting between Terra and the sun."," Major Hendricks went on. Off to the right something scuttled, something round and metallic. A claw, going lickety-split after something. Probably after a small animal, a rat. They got rats, too. As a sort of sideline."," He came to the top of the little hill and lifted his fieldglasses. The Russian lines were a few miles ahead of him. They had a forward command post there. The runner had come from it."," A squat robot with undulating arms passed by him, its arms weaving inquiringly. The robot went on its way, disappearing under some debris. Hendricks watched it go. He had never seen that type before. There were getting to be more and more types he had never seen, new varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories."," Hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on. It was interesting, the use of artificial forms in warfare. How had they got started? Necessity. The Soviet Union had gained great initial success, usual with the side that got the war going. Most of North America had been blasted off the map. Retaliation was quick in coming, of course. The sky was full of circling disc-bombers long before the war began; they had been up there for years. The discs began sailing down all over Russia within hours after Washington got it."," *****"," But that hadn't helped Washington."," The American bloc governments moved to the Moon Base the first year. There was not much else to do. Europe was gone; a slag heap with dark weeds growing from the ashes and bones. Most of North America was useless; nothing could be planted, no one could live. A few million people kept going up in Canada and down in South America. But during the second year Soviet parachutists began to drop, a few at first, then more and more. They wore the first really effective anti-radiation equipment; what was left of American production moved to the moon along with the governments."," All but the troops. The remaining troops stayed behind as best they could, a few thousand here, a platoon there. No one knew exactly where they were; they stayed where they could, moving around at night, hiding in ruins, in sewers, cellars, with the rats and snakes. It looked as if the Soviet Union had the war almost won. Except for a handful of projectiles fired off from the moon daily, there was almost no weapon in use against them. They came and went as they pleased. The war, for all practical purposes, was over. Nothing effective opposed them."," *****"," And then the first claws appeared. And overnight the complexion of the war changed."," The claws were awkward, at first. Slow. The Ivans knocked them off almost as fast as they crawled out of their underground tunnels. But then they got better, faster and more cunning. Factories, all on Terra, turned them out. Factories a long way under ground, behind the Soviet lines, factories that had once made atomic projectiles, now almost forgotten."," The claws got faster, and they got bigger. New types appeared, some with feelers, some that flew. There were a few jumping kinds."," The best technicians on the moon were working on designs, making them more and more intricate, more flexible. They became uncanny; the Ivans were having a lot of trouble with them. Some of the little claws were learning to hide themselves, burrowing down into the ash, lying in wait."," And then they started getting into the Russian bunkers, slipping down when the lids were raised for air and a look around. One claw inside a bunker, a churning sphere of blades and metal--that was enough. And when one got in others followed. With a weapon like that the war couldn't go on much longer."," Maybe it was already over."," Maybe he was going to hear the news. Maybe the Politburo had decided to throw in the sponge. Too bad it had taken so long. Six years. A long time for war like that, the way they had waged it. The automatic retaliation discs, spinning down all over Russia, hundreds of thousands of them. Bacteria crystals. The Soviet guided missiles, whistling through the air. The chain bombs. And now this, the robots, the claws--"," The claws weren't like other weapons. They were alive, from any practical standpoint, whether the Governments wanted to admit it or not. They were not machines. They were living things, spinning, creeping, shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting toward a man, climbing up him, rushing for his throat. And that was what they had been designed to do. Their job."," They did their job well. Especially lately, with the new designs coming up. Now they repaired themselves. They were on their own. Radiation tabs protected the UN troops, but if a man lost his tab he was fair game for the claws, no matter what his uniform. Down below the surface automatic machinery stamped them out. Human beings stayed a long way off. It was too risky; nobody wanted to be around them. They were left to themselves. And they seemed to be doing all right. The new designs were faster, more complex. More efficient."," Apparently they had won the war."," *****"," Major Hendricks lit a second cigarette. The landscape depressed him. Nothing but ash and ruins. He seemed to be alone, the only living thing in the whole world. To the right the ruins of a town rose up, a few walls and heaps of debris. He tossed the dead match away, increasing his pace. Suddenly he stopped, jerking up his gun, his body tense. For a minute it looked like--"," From behind the shell of a ruined building a figure came, walking slowly toward him, walking hesitantly."," Hendricks blinked. \"Stop!\""," The boy stopped. Hendricks lowered his gun. The boy stood silently, looking at him. He was small, not very old. Perhaps eight. But it was hard to tell. Most of the kids who remained were stunted. He wore a faded blue sweater, ragged with dirt, and short pants. His hair was long and matted. Brown hair. It hung over his face and around his ears. He held something in his arms."," \"What's that you have?\" Hendricks said sharply."," The boy held it out. It was a toy, a bear. A teddy bear. The boy's eyes were large, but without expression."," Hendricks relaxed. \"I don't want it. Keep it.\""," The boy hugged the bear again."," \"Where do you live?\" Hendricks said."," \"In there.\""," \"The ruins?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"Underground?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"How many are there?\""," \"How--how many?\""," \"How many of you. How big's your settlement?\""," The boy did not answer."," Hendricks frowned. \"You're not all by yourself, are you?\""," The boy nodded."," \"How do you stay alive?\""," \"There's food.\""," \"What kind of food?\""," \"Different.\""," Hendricks studied him. \"How old are you?\""," \"Thirteen.\""," *****"," It wasn't possible. Or was it? The boy was thin, stunted. And probably sterile. Radiation exposure, years straight. No wonder he was so small. His arms and legs were like pipecleaners, knobby, and thin. Hendricks touched the boy's arm. His skin was dry and rough; radiation skin. He bent down, looking into the boy's face. There was no expression. Big eyes, big and dark."," \"Are you blind?\" Hendricks said."," \"No. I can see some.\""," \"How do you get away from the claws?\""," \"The claws?\""," \"The round things. That run and burrow.\""," \"I don't understand.\""," Maybe there weren't any claws around. A lot of areas were free. They collected mostly around bunkers, where there were people. The claws had been designed to sense warmth, warmth of living things."," \"You're lucky.\" Hendricks straightened up. \"Well? Which way are you going? Back--back there?\""," \"Can I come with you?\""," \"With me?\" Hendricks folded his arms. \"I'm going a long way. Miles. I have to hurry.\" He looked at his watch. \"I have to get there by nightfall.\""," \"I want to come.\""," Hendricks fumbled in his pack. \"It isn't worth it. Here.\" He tossed down the food cans he had with him. \"You take these and go back. Okay?\""," The boy said nothing."," \"I'll be coming back this way. In a day or so. If you're around here when I come back you can come along with me. All right?\""," \"I want to go with you now.\""," \"It's a long walk.\""," \"I can walk.\""," Hendricks shifted uneasily. It made too good a target, two people walking along. And the boy would slow him down. But he might not come back this way. And if the boy were really all alone--"," \"Okay. Come along.\""," *****"," The boy fell in beside him. Hendricks strode along. The boy walked silently, clutching his teddy bear."," \"What's your name?\" Hendricks said, after a time."," \"David Edward Derring.\""," \"David? What--what happened to your mother and father?\""," \"They died.\""," \"How?\""," \"In the blast.\""," \"How long ago?\""," \"Six years.\""," Hendricks slowed down. \"You've been alone six years?\""," \"No. There were other people for awhile. They went away.\""," \"And you've been alone since?\""," \"Yes.\""," Hendricks glanced down. The boy was strange, saying very little. Withdrawn. But that was the way they were, the children who had survived. Quiet. Stoic. A strange kind of fatalism gripped them. Nothing came as a surprise. They accepted anything that came along. There was no longer any normal, any natural course of things, moral or physical, for them to expect. Custom, habit, all the determining forces of learning were gone; only brute experience remained."," \"Am I walking too fast?\" Hendricks said."," \"No.\""," \"How did you happen to see me?\""," \"I was waiting.\""," \"Waiting?\" Hendricks was puzzled. \"What were you waiting for?\""," \"To catch things.\""," \"What kind of things?\""," \"Things to eat.\""," \"Oh.\" Hendricks set his lips grimly. A thirteen year old boy, living on rats and gophers and half-rotten canned food. Down in a hole under the ruins of a town. With radiation pools and claws, and Russian dive-mines up above, coasting around in the sky."," \"Where are we going?\" David asked."," \"To the Russian lines.\""," \"Russian?\""," \"The enemy. The people who started the war. They dropped the first radiation bombs. They began all this.\""," The boy nodded. His face showed no expression."," \"I'm an American,\" Hendricks said."," There was no comment. On they went, the two of them, Hendricks walking a little ahead, David trailing behind him, hugging his dirty teddy bear against his chest."," *****"," About four in the afternoon they stopped to eat. Hendricks built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete. He cleared the weeds away and heaped up bits of wood. The Russians' lines were not very far ahead. Around him was what had once been a long valley, acres of fruit trees and grapes. Nothing remained now but a few bleak stumps and the mountains that stretched across the horizon at the far end. And the clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind, settling over the weeds and remains of buildings, walls here and there, once in awhile what had been a road."," Hendricks made coffee and heated up some boiled mutton and bread. \"Here.\" He handed bread and mutton to David. David squatted by the edge of the fire, his knees knobby and white. He examined the food and then passed it back, shaking his head."," \"No.\""," \"No? Don't you want any?\""," \"No.\""," Hendricks shrugged. Maybe the boy was a mutant, used to special food. It didn't matter. When he was hungry he would find something to eat. The boy was strange. But there were many strange changes coming over the world. Life was not the same, anymore. It would never be the same again. The human race was going to have to realize that."," \"Suit yourself,\" Hendricks said. He ate the bread and mutton by himself, washing it down with coffee. He ate slowly, finding the food hard to digest. When he was done he got to his feet and stamped the fire out."," David rose slowly, watching him with his young-old eyes."," \"We're going,\" Hendricks said."," \"All right.\""," Hendricks walked along, his gun in his arms. They were close; he was tense, ready for anything. The Russians should be expecting a runner, an answer to their own runner, but they were tricky. There was always the possibility of a slipup. He scanned the landscape around him. Nothing but slag and ash, a few hills, charred trees. Concrete walls. But someplace ahead was the first bunker of the Russian lines, the forward command. Underground, buried deep, with only a periscope showing, a few gun muzzles. Maybe an antenna."," \"Will we be there soon?\" David asked."," \"Yes. Getting tired?\""," \"No.\""," \"Why, then?\""," David did not answer. He plodded carefully along behind, picking his way over the ash. His legs and shoes were gray with dust. His pinched face was streaked, lines of gray ash in riverlets down the pale white of his skin. There was no color to his face. Typical of the new children, growing up in cellars and sewers and underground shelters."," *****"," Hendricks slowed down. He lifted his fieldglasses and studied the ground ahead of him. Were they there, someplace, waiting for him? Watching him, the way his men had watched the Russian runner? A chill went up his back. Maybe they were getting their guns ready, preparing to fire, the way his men had prepared, made ready to kill."," Hendricks stopped, wiping perspiration from his face. \"Damn.\" It made him uneasy. But he should be expected. The situation was different."," He strode over the ash, holding his gun tightly with both hands. Behind him came David. Hendricks peered around, tight-lipped. Any second it might happen. A burst of white light, a blast, carefully aimed from inside a deep concrete bunker."," He raised his arm and waved it around in a circle."," Nothing moved. To the right a long ridge ran, topped with dead tree trunks. A few wild vines had grown up around the trees, remains of arbors. And the eternal dark weeds. Hendricks studied the ridge. Was anything up there? Perfect place for a lookout. He approached the ridge warily, David coming silently behind. If it were his command he'd have a sentry up there, watching for troops trying to infiltrate into the command area. Of course, if it were his command there would be the claws around the area for full protection."," He stopped, feet apart, hands on his hips."," \"Are we there?\" David said."," \"Almost.\""," \"Why have we stopped?\""," \"I don't want to take any chances.\" Hendricks advanced slowly. Now the ridge lay directly beside him, along his right. Overlooking him. His uneasy feeling increased. If an Ivan were up there he wouldn't have a chance. He waved his arm again. They should be expecting someone in the UN uniform, in response to the note capsule. Unless the whole thing was a trap."," \"Keep up with me.\" He turned toward David. \"Don't drop behind.\""," \"With you?\""," \"Up beside me! We're close. We can't take any chances. Come on.\""," \"I'll be all right.\" David remained behind him, in the rear, a few paces away, still clutching his teddy bear."," \"Have it your way.\" Hendricks raised his glasses again, suddenly tense. For a moment--had something moved? He scanned the ridge carefully. Everything was silent. Dead. No life up there, only tree trunks and ash. Maybe a few rats. The big black rats that had survived the claws. Mutants--built their own shelters out of saliva and ash. Some kind of plaster. Adaptation. He started forward again."," *****"," A tall figure came out on the ridge above him, cloak flapping. Gray-green. A Russian. Behind him a second soldier appeared, another Russian. Both lifted their guns, aiming."," Hendricks froze. He opened his mouth. The soldiers were kneeling, sighting down the side of the slope. A third figure had joined them on the ridge top, a smaller figure in gray-green. A woman. She stood behind the other two."," Hendricks found his voice. \"Stop!\" He waved up at them frantically. \"I'm--\""," The two Russians fired. Behind Hendricks there was a faint pop. Waves of heat lapped against him, throwing him to the ground. Ash tore at his face, grinding into his eyes and nose. Choking, he pulled himself to his knees. It was all a trap. He was finished. He had come to be killed, like a steer. The soldiers and the woman were coming down the side of the ridge toward him, sliding down through the soft ash. Hendricks was numb. His head throbbed. Awkwardly, he got his rifle up and took aim. It weighed a thousand tons; he could hardly hold it. His nose and cheeks stung. The air was full of the blast smell, a bitter acrid stench."," \"Don't fire,\" the first Russian said, in heavily accented English."," The three of them came up to him, surrounding him. \"Put down your rifle, Yank,\" the other said."," Hendricks was dazed. Everything had happened so fast. He had been caught. And they had blasted the boy. He turned his head. David was gone. What remained of him was strewn across the ground."," The three Russians studied him curiously. Hendricks sat, wiping blood from his nose, picking out bits of ash. He shook his head, trying to clear it. \"Why did you do it?\" he murmured thickly. \"The boy.\""," \"Why?\" One of the soldiers helped him roughly to his feet. He turned Hendricks around. \"Look.\""," Hendricks closed his eyes."," \"Look!\" The two Russians pulled him forward. \"See. Hurry up. There isn't much time to spare, Yank!\""," Hendricks looked. And gasped."," \"See now? Now do you understand?\""," *****"," From the remains of David a metal wheel rolled. Relays, glinting metal. Parts, wiring. One of the Russians kicked at the heap of remains. Parts popped out, rolling away, wheels and springs and rods. A plastic section fell in, half charred. Hendricks bent shakily down. The front of the head had come off. He could make out the intricate brain, wires and relays, tiny tubes and switches, thousands of minute studs--"," \"A robot,\" the soldier holding his arm said. \"We watched it tagging you.\""," \"Tagging me?\""," \"That's their way. They tag along with you. Into the bunker. That's how they get in.\""," Hendricks blinked, dazed. \"But--\""," \"Come on.\" They led him toward the ridge. \"We can't stay here. It isn't safe. There must be hundreds of them all around here.\""," The three of them pulled him up the side of the ridge, sliding and slipping on the ash. The woman reached the top and stood waiting for them."," \"The forward command,\" Hendricks muttered. \"I came to negotiate with the Soviet--\""," \"There is no more forward command. They got in. We'll explain.\" They reached the top of the ridge. \"We're all that's left. The three of us. The rest were down in the bunker.\""," \"This way. Down this way.\" The woman unscrewed a lid, a gray manhole cover set in the ground. \"Get in.\""," Hendricks lowered himself. The two soldiers and the woman came behind him, following him down the ladder. The woman closed the lid after them, bolting it tightly into place."," \"Good thing we saw you,\" one of the two soldiers grunted. \"It had tagged you about as far as it was going to.\""," *****"," \"Give me one of your cigarettes,\" the woman said. \"I haven't had an American cigarette for weeks.\""," Hendricks pushed the pack to her. She took a cigarette and passed the pack to the two soldiers. In the corner of the small room the lamp gleamed fitfully. The room was low-ceilinged, cramped. The four of them sat around a small wood table. A few dirty dishes were stacked to one side. Behind a ragged curtain a second room was partly visible. Hendricks saw the corner of a cot, some blankets, clothes hung on a hook."," \"We were here,\" the soldier beside him said. He took off his helmet, pushing his blond hair back. \"I'm Corporal Rudi Maxer. Polish. Impressed in the Soviet Army two years ago.\" He held out his hand."," Hendricks hesitated and then shook. \"Major Joseph Hendricks.\""," \"Klaus Epstein.\" The other soldier shook with him, a small dark man with thinning hair. Epstein plucked nervously at his ear. \"Austrian. Impressed God knows when. I don't remember. The three of us were here, Rudi and I, with Tasso.\" He indicated the woman. \"That's how we escaped. All the rest were down in the bunker.\""," \"And--and they got in?\""," Epstein lit a cigarette. \"First just one of them. The kind that tagged you. Then it let others in.\""," Hendricks became alert. \"The kind? Are there more than one kind?\""," \"The little boy. David. David holding his teddy bear. That's Variety Three. The most effective.\""," \"What are the other types?\""," Epstein reached into his coat. \"Here.\" He tossed a packet of photographs onto the table, tied with a string. \"Look for yourself.\""," Hendricks untied the string."," \"You see,\" Rudi Maxer said, \"that was why we wanted to talk terms. The Russians, I mean. We found out about a week ago. Found out that your claws were beginning to make up new designs on their own. New types of their own. Better types. Down in your underground factories behind our lines. You let them stamp themselves, repair themselves. Made them more and more intricate. It's your fault this happened.\""," *****"," Hendricks examined the photos. They had been snapped hurriedly; they were blurred and indistinct. The first few showed--David. David walking along a road, by himself. David and another David. Three Davids. All exactly alike. Each with a ragged teddy bear."," All pathetic."," \"Look at the others,\" Tasso said."," The next pictures, taken at a great distance, showed a towering wounded soldier sitting by the side of a path, his arm in a sling, the stump of one leg extended, a crude crutch on his lap. Then two wounded soldiers, both the same, standing side by side."," \"That's Variety One. The Wounded Soldier.\" Klaus reached out and took the pictures. \"You see, the claws were designed to get to human beings. To find them. Each kind was better than the last. They got farther, closer, past most of our defenses, into our lines. But as long as they were merely machines, metal spheres with claws and horns, feelers, they could be picked off like any other object. They could be detected as lethal robots as soon as they were seen. Once we caught sight of them--\""," \"Variety One subverted our whole north wing,\" Rudi said. \"It was a long time before anyone caught on. Then it was too late. They came in, wounded soldiers, knocking and begging to be let in. So we let them in. And as soon as they were in they took over. We were watching out for machines....\""," \"At that time it was thought there was only the one type,\" Klaus Epstein said. \"No one suspected there were other types. The pictures were flashed to us. When the runner was sent to you, we knew of just one type. Variety One. The big Wounded Soldier. We thought that was all.\""," \"Your line fell to--\""," \"To Variety Three. David and his bear. That worked even better.\" Klaus smiled bitterly. \"Soldiers are suckers for children. We brought them in and tried to feed them. We found out the hard way what they were after. At least, those who were in the bunker.\""," \"The three of us were lucky,\" Rudi said. \"Klaus and I were--were visiting Tasso when it happened. This is her place.\" He waved a big hand around. \"This little cellar. We finished and climbed the ladder to start back. From the ridge we saw. There they were, all around the bunker. Fighting was still going on. David and his bear. Hundreds of them. Klaus took the pictures.\""," Klaus tied up the photographs again."," *****"," \"And it's going on all along your line?\" Hendricks said."," \"Yes.\""," \"How about our lines?\" Without thinking, he touched the tab on his arm. \"Can they--\""," \"They're not bothered by your radiation tabs. It makes no difference to them, Russian, American, Pole, German. It's all the same. They're doing what they were designed to do. Carrying out the original idea. They track down life, wherever they find it.\""," \"They go by warmth,\" Klaus said. \"That was the way you constructed them from the very start. Of course, those you designed were kept back by the radiation tabs you wear. Now they've got around that. These new varieties are lead-lined.\""," \"What's the other variety?\" Hendricks asked. \"The David type, the Wounded Soldier--what's the other?\""," \"We don't know.\" Klaus pointed up at the wall. On the wall were two metal plates, ragged at the edges. Hendricks got up and studied them. They were bent and dented."," \"The one on the left came off a Wounded Soldier,\" Rudi said. \"We got one of them. It was going along toward our old bunker. We got it from the ridge, the same way we got the David tagging you.\""," The plate was stamped: I-V. Hendricks touched the other plate. \"And this came from the David type?\""," \"Yes.\" The plate was stamped: III-V."," Klaus took a look at them, leaning over Hendricks' broad shoulder. \"You can see what we're up against. There's another type. Maybe it was abandoned. Maybe it didn't work. But there must be a Second Variety. There's One and Three.\""," \"You were lucky,\" Rudi said. \"The David tagged you all the way here and never touched you. Probably thought you'd get it into a bunker, somewhere.\""," \"One gets in and it's all over,\" Klaus said. \"They move fast. One lets all the rest inside. They're inflexible. Machines with one purpose. They were built for only one thing.\" He rubbed sweat from his lip. \"We saw.\""," They were silent."," \"Let me have another cigarette, Yank,\" Tasso said. \"They are good. I almost forgot how they were.\""," *****"," It was night. The sky was black. No stars were visible through the rolling clouds of ash. Klaus lifted the lid cautiously so that Hendricks could look out."," Rudi pointed into the darkness. \"Over that way are the bunkers. Where we used to be. Not over half a mile from us. It was just chance Klaus and I were not there when it happened. Weakness. Saved by our lusts.\""," \"All the rest must be dead,\" Klaus said in a low voice. \"It came quickly. This morning the Politburo reached their decision. They notified us--forward command. Our runner was sent out at once. We saw him start toward the direction of your lines. We covered him until he was out of sight.\""," \"Alex Radrivsky. We both knew him. He disappeared about six o'clock. The sun had just come up. About noon Klaus and I had an hour relief. We crept off, away from the bunkers. No one was watching. We came here. There used to be a town here, a few houses, a street. This cellar was part of a big farmhouse. We knew Tasso would be here, hiding down in her little place. We had come here before. Others from the bunkers came here. Today happened to be our turn.\""," \"So we were saved,\" Klaus said. \"Chance. It might have been others. We--we finished, and then we came up to the surface and started back along the ridge. That was when we saw them, the Davids. We understood right away. We had seen the photos of the First Variety, the Wounded Soldier. Our Commissar distributed them to us with an explanation. If we had gone another step they would have seen us. As it was we had to blast two Davids before we got back. There were hundreds of them, all around. Like ants. We took pictures and slipped back here, bolting the lid tight.\""," \"They're not so much when you catch them alone. We moved faster than they did. But they're inexorable. Not like living things. They came right at us. And we blasted them.\""," Major Hendricks rested against the edge of the lid, adjusting his eyes to the darkness. \"Is it safe to have the lid up at all?\""," \"If we're careful. How else can you operate your transmitter?\""," Hendricks lifted the small belt transmitter slowly. He pressed it against his ear. The metal was cold and damp. He blew against the mike, raising up the short antenna. A faint hum sounded in his ear. \"That's true, I suppose.\""," But he still hesitated."," \"We'll pull you under if anything happens,\" Klaus said."," \"Thanks.\" Hendricks waited a moment, resting the transmitter against his shoulder. \"Interesting, isn't it?\""," \"What?\""," \"This, the new types. The new varieties of claws. We're completely at their mercy, aren't we? By now they've probably gotten into the UN lines, too. It makes me wonder if we're not seeing the beginning of a now species. The new species. Evolution. The race to come after man.\""," *****"," Rudi grunted. \"There is no race after man.\""," \"No? Why not? Maybe we're seeing it now, the end of human beings, the beginning of the new society.\""," \"They're not a race. They're mechanical killers. You made them to destroy. That's all they can do. They're machines with a job.\""," \"So it seems now. But how about later on? After the war is over. Maybe, when there aren't any humans to destroy, their real potentialities will begin to show.\""," \"You talk as if they were alive!\""," \"Aren't they?\""," There was silence. \"They're machines,\" Rudi said. \"They look like people, but they're machines.\""," \"Use your transmitter, Major,\" Klaus said. \"We can't stay up here forever.\""," Holding the transmitter tightly Hendricks called the code of the command bunker. He waited, listening. No response. Only silence. He checked the leads carefully. Everything was in place."," \"Scott!\" he said into the mike. \"Can you hear me?\""," Silence. He raised the gain up full and tried again. Only static."," \"I don't get anything. They may hear me but they may not want to answer.\""," \"Tell them it's an emergency.\""," \"They'll think I'm being forced to call. Under your direction.\" He tried again, outlining briefly what he had learned. But still the phone was silent, except for the faint static."," \"Radiation pools kill most transmission,\" Klaus said, after awhile. \"Maybe that's it.\""," Hendricks shut the transmitter up. \"No use. No answer. Radiation pools? Maybe. Or they hear me, but won't answer. Frankly, that's what I would do, if a runner tried to call from the Soviet lines. They have no reason to believe such a story. They may hear everything I say--\""," \"Or maybe it's too late.\""," Hendricks nodded."," \"We better get the lid down,\" Rudi said nervously. \"We don't want to take unnecessary chances.\""," *****"," They climbed slowly back down the tunnel. Klaus bolted the lid carefully into place. They descended into the kitchen. The air was heavy and close around them."," \"Could they work that fast?\" Hendricks said. \"I left the bunker this noon. Ten hours ago. How could they move so quickly?\""," \"It doesn't take them long. Not after the first one gets in. It goes wild. You know what the little claws can do. Even one of these is beyond belief. Razors, each finger. Maniacal.\""," \"All right.\" Hendricks moved away impatiently. He stood with his back to them."," \"What's the matter?\" Rudi said."," \"The Moon Base. God, if they've gotten there--\""," \"The Moon Base?\""," Hendricks turned around. \"They couldn't have got to the Moon Base. How would they get there? It isn't possible. I can't believe it.\""," \"What is this Moon Base? We've heard rumors, but nothing definite. What is the actual situation? You seem concerned.\""," \"We're supplied from the moon. The governments are there, under the lunar surface. All our people and industries. That's what keeps us going. If they should find some way of getting off Terra, onto the moon--\""," \"It only takes one of them. Once the first one gets in it admits the others. Hundreds of them, all alike. You should have seen them. Identical. Like ants.\""," \"Perfect socialism,\" Tasso said. \"The ideal of the communist state. All citizens interchangeable.\""," Klaus grunted angrily. \"That's enough. Well? What next?\""," Hendricks paced back and forth, around the small room. The air was full of smells of food and perspiration. The others watched him. Presently Tasso pushed through the curtain, into the other room. \"I'm going to take a nap.\""," The curtain closed behind her. Rudi and Klaus sat down at the table, still watching Hendricks."," \"It's up to you,\" Klaus said. \"We don't know your situation.\""," Hendricks nodded."," \"It's a problem.\" Rudi drank some coffee, filling his cup from a rusty pot. \"We're safe here for awhile, but we can't stay here forever. Not enough food or supplies.\""," \"But if we go outside--\""," \"If we go outside they'll get us. Or probably they'll get us. We couldn't go very far. How far is your command bunker, Major?\""," \"Three or four miles.\""," \"We might make it. The four of us. Four of us could watch all sides. They couldn't slip up behind us and start tagging us. We have three rifles, three blast rifles. Tasso can have my pistol.\" Rudi tapped his belt. \"In the Soviet army we didn't have shoes always, but we had guns. With all four of us armed one of us might get to your command bunker. Preferably you, Major.\""," \"What if they're already there?\" Klaus said."," Rudi shrugged. \"Well, then we come back here.\""," *****"," Hendricks stopped pacing. \"What do you think the chances are they're already in the American lines?\""," \"Hard to say. Fairly good. They're organized. They know exactly what they're doing. Once they start they go like a horde of locusts. They have to keep moving, and fast. It's secrecy and speed they depend on. Surprise. They push their way in before anyone has any idea.\""," \"I see,\" Hendricks murmured."," From the other room Tasso stirred. \"Major?\""," Hendricks pushed the curtain back. \"What?\"","",""," Tasso looked up at him lazily from the cot. \"Have you any more American cigarettes left?\""," Hendricks went into the room and sat down across from her, on a wood stool. He felt in his pockets. \"No. All gone.\""," \"Too bad.\""," \"What nationality are you?\" Hendricks asked after awhile."," \"Russian.\""," \"How did you get here?\""," \"Here?\""," \"This used to be France. This was part of Normandy. Did you come with the Soviet army?\""," \"Why?\""," \"Just curious.\" He studied her. She had taken off her coat, tossing it over the end of the cot. She was young, about twenty. Slim. Her long hair stretched out over the pillow. She was staring at him silently, her eyes dark and large."," \"What's on your mind?\" Tasso said."," \"Nothing. How old are you?\""," \"Eighteen.\" She continued to watch him, unblinking, her arms behind her head. She had on Russian army pants and shirt. Gray-green. Thick leather belt with counter and cartridges. Medicine kit."," \"You're in the Soviet army?\""," \"No.\""," \"Where did you get the uniform?\""," She shrugged. \"It was given to me,\" she told him."," \"How--how old were you when you came here?\""," \"Sixteen.\""," \"That young?\""," Her eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean?\""," *****"," Hendricks rubbed his jaw. \"Your life would have been a lot different if there had been no war. Sixteen. You came here at sixteen. To live this way.\""," \"I had to survive.\""," \"I'm not moralizing.\""," \"Your life would have been different, too,\" Tasso murmured. She reached down and unfastened one of her boots. She kicked the boot off, onto the floor. \"Major, do you want to go in the other room? I'm sleepy.\""," \"It's going to be a problem, the four of us here. It's going to be hard to live in these quarters. Are there just the two rooms?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"How big was the cellar originally? Was it larger than this? Are there other rooms filled up with debris? We might be able to open one of them.\""," \"Perhaps. I really don't know.\" Tasso loosened her belt. She made herself comfortable on the cot, unbuttoning her shirt. \"You're sure you have no more cigarettes?\""," \"I had only the one pack.\""," \"Too bad. Maybe if we get back to your bunker we can find some.\" The other boot fell. Tasso reached up for the light cord. \"Good night.\""," \"You're going to sleep?\""," \"That's right.\""," The room plunged into darkness. Hendricks got up and made his way past the curtain, into the kitchen."," And stopped, rigid."," Rudi stood against the wall, his face white and gleaming. His mouth opened and closed but no sounds came. Klaus stood in front of him, the muzzle of his pistol in Rudi's stomach. Neither of them moved. Klaus, his hand tight around his gun, his features set. Rudi, pale and silent, spread-eagled against the wall."," \"What--\" Hendricks muttered, but Klaus cut him off."," \"Be quiet, Major. Come over here. Your gun. Get out your gun.\""," Hendricks drew his pistol. \"What is it?\""," \"Cover him.\" Klaus motioned him forward. \"Beside me. Hurry!\""," Rudi moved a little, lowering his arms. He turned to Hendricks, licking his lips. The whites of his eyes shone wildly. Sweat dripped from his forehead, down his cheeks. He fixed his gaze on Hendricks. \"Major, he's gone insane. Stop him.\" Rudi's voice was thin and hoarse, almost inaudible."," \"What's going on?\" Hendricks demanded."," Without lowering his pistol Klaus answered. \"Major, remember our discussion? The Three Varieties? We knew about One and Three. But we didn't know about Two. At least, we didn't know before.\" Klaus' fingers tightened around the gun butt. \"We didn't know before, but we know now.\""," He pressed the trigger. A burst of white heat rolled out of the gun, licking around Rudi."," \"Major, this is the Second Variety.\""," *****"," Tasso swept the curtain aside. \"Klaus! What did you do?\""," Klaus turned from the charred form, gradually sinking down the wall onto the floor. \"The Second Variety, Tasso. Now we know. We have all three types identified. The danger is less. I--\""," Tasso stared past him at the remains of Rudi, at the blackened, smouldering fragments and bits of cloth. \"You killed him.\""," \"Him? It, you mean. I was watching. I had a feeling, but I wasn't sure. At least, I wasn't sure before. But this evening I was certain.\" Klaus rubbed his pistol butt nervously. \"We're lucky. Don't you understand? Another hour and it might--\""," \"You were certain?\" Tasso pushed past him and bent down, over the steaming remains on the floor. Her face became hard. \"Major, see for yourself. Bones. Flesh.\""," Hendricks bent down beside her. The remains were human remains. Seared flesh, charred bone fragments, part of a skull. Ligaments, viscera, blood. Blood forming a pool against the wall."," \"No wheels,\" Tasso said calmly. She straightened up. \"No wheels, no parts, no relays. Not a claw. Not the Second Variety.\" She folded her arms. \"You're going to have to be able to explain this.\""," Klaus sat down at the table, all the color drained suddenly from his face. He put his head in his hands and rocked back and forth."," \"Snap out of it.\" Tasso's fingers closed over his shoulder. \"Why did you do it? Why did you kill him?\""," \"He was frightened,\" Hendricks said. \"All this, the whole thing, building up around us.\""," \"Maybe.\""," \"What, then? What do you think?\""," \"I think he may have had a reason for killing Rudi. A good reason.\""," \"What reason?\""," \"Maybe Rudi learned something.\""," Hendricks studied her bleak face. \"About what?\" he asked."," \"About him. About Klaus.\""," *****"," Klaus looked up quickly. \"You can see what she's trying to say. She thinks I'm the Second Variety. Don't you see, Major? Now she wants you to believe I killed him on purpose. That I'm--\""," \"Why did you kill him, then?\" Tasso said."," \"I told you.\" Klaus shook his head wearily. \"I thought he was a claw. I thought I knew.\""," \"Why?\""," \"I had been watching him. I was suspicious.\""," \"Why?\""," \"I thought I had seen something. Heard something. I thought I--\" He stopped."," \"Go on.\""," \"We were sitting at the table. Playing cards. You two were in the other room. It was silent. I thought I heard him--whirr.\""," There was silence."," \"Do you believe that?\" Tasso said to Hendricks."," \"Yes. I believe what he says.\""," \"I don't. I think he killed Rudi for a good purpose.\" Tasso touched the rifle, resting in the corner of the room. \"Major--\""," \"No.\" Hendricks shook his head. \"Let's stop it right now. One is enough. We're afraid, the way he was. If we kill him we'll be doing what he did to Rudi.\""," Klaus looked gratefully up at him. \"Thanks. I was afraid. You understand, don't you? Now she's afraid, the way I was. She wants to kill me.\""," \"No more killing.\" Hendricks moved toward the end of the ladder. \"I'm going above and try the transmitter once more. If I can't get them we're moving back toward my lines tomorrow morning.\""," Klaus rose quickly. \"I'll come up with you and give you a hand.\""," *****"," The night air was cold. The earth was cooling off. Klaus took a deep breath, filling his lungs. He and Hendricks stepped onto the ground, out of the tunnel. Klaus planted his feet wide apart, the rifle up, watching and listening. Hendricks crouched by the tunnel mouth, tuning the small transmitter."," \"Any luck?\" Klaus asked presently."," \"Not yet.\""," \"Keep trying. Tell them what happened.\""," Hendricks kept trying. Without success. Finally he lowered the antenna. \"It's useless. They can't hear me. Or they hear me and won't answer. Or--\""," \"Or they don't exist.\""," \"I'll try once more.\" Hendricks raised the antenna. \"Scott, can you hear me? Come in!\""," He listened. There was only static. Then, still very faintly--"," \"This is Scott.\""," His fingers tightened. \"Scott! Is it you?\""," \"This is Scott.\""," Klaus squatted down. \"Is it your command?\""," \"Scott, listen. Do you understand? About them, the claws. Did you get my message? Did you hear me?\""," \"Yes.\" Faintly. Almost inaudible. He could hardly make out the word."," \"You got my message? Is everything all right at the bunker? None of them have got in?\""," \"Everything is all right.\""," \"Have they tried to get in?\""," The voice was weaker."," \"No.\""," Hendricks turned to Klaus. \"They're all right.\""," \"Have they been attacked?\""," \"No.\" Hendricks pressed the phone tighter to his ear. \"Scott, I can hardly hear you. Have you notified the Moon Base? Do they know? Are they alerted?\""," No answer."," \"Scott! Can you hear me?\""," Silence."," Hendricks relaxed, sagging. \"Faded out. Must be radiation pools.\""," *****"," Hendricks and Klaus looked at each other. Neither of them said anything. After a time Klaus said, \"Did it sound like any of your men? Could you identify the voice?\""," \"It was too faint.\""," \"You couldn't be certain?\""," \"No.\""," \"Then it could have been--\""," \"I don't know. Now I'm not sure. Let's go back down and get the lid closed.\""," They climbed back down the ladder slowly, into the warm cellar. Klaus bolted the lid behind them. Tasso waited for them, her face expressionless."," \"Any luck?\" she asked."," Neither of them answered. \"Well?\" Klaus said at last. \"What do you think, Major? Was it your officer, or was it one of them?\""," \"I don't know.\""," \"Then we're just where we were before.\""," Hendricks stared down at the floor, his jaw set. \"We'll have to go. To be sure.\""," \"Anyhow, we have food here for only a few weeks. We'd have to go up after that, in any case.\""," \"Apparently so.\""," \"What's wrong?\" Tasso demanded. \"Did you get across to your bunker? What's the matter?\""," \"It may have been one of my men,\" Hendricks said slowly. \"Or it may have been one of them. But we'll never know standing here.\" He examined his watch. \"Let's turn in and get some sleep. We want to be up early tomorrow.\""," \"Early?\""," \"Our best chance to get through the claws should be early in the morning,\" Hendricks said."," *****"," The morning was crisp and clear. Major Hendricks studied the countryside through his fieldglasses."," \"See anything?\" Klaus said."," \"No.\""," \"Can you make out our bunkers?\""," \"Which way?\""," \"Here.\" Klaus took the glasses and adjusted them. \"I know where to look.\" He looked a long time, silently."," Tasso came to the top of the tunnel and stepped up onto the ground. \"Anything?\""," \"No.\" Klaus passed the glasses back to Hendricks. \"They're out of sight. Come on. Let's not stay here.\""," The three of them made their way down the side of the ridge, sliding in the soft ash. Across a flat rock a lizard scuttled. They stopped instantly, rigid."," \"What was it?\" Klaus muttered."," \"A lizard.\""," The lizard ran on, hurrying through the ash. It was exactly the same color as the ash."," \"Perfect adaptation,\" Klaus said. \"Proves we were right. Lysenko, I mean.\""," They reached the bottom of the ridge and stopped, standing close together, looking around them."," \"Let's go.\" Hendricks started off. \"It's a good long trip, on foot.\""," Klaus fell in beside him. Tasso walked behind, her pistol held alertly. \"Major, I've been meaning to ask you something,\" Klaus said. \"How did you run across the David? The one that was tagging you.\""," \"I met it along the way. In some ruins.\""," \"What did it say?\""," \"Not much. It said it was alone. By itself.\""," \"You couldn't tell it was a machine? It talked like a living person? You never suspected?\""," \"It didn't say much. I noticed nothing unusual."," \"It's strange, machines so much like people that you can be fooled. Almost alive. I wonder where it'll end.\""," \"They're doing what you Yanks designed them to do,\" Tasso said. \"You designed them to hunt out life and destroy. Human life. Wherever they find it.\""," *****"," Hendricks was watching Klaus intently. \"Why did you ask me? What's on your mind?\""," \"Nothing,\" Klaus answered."," \"Klaus thinks you're the Second Variety,\" Tasso said calmly, from behind them. \"Now he's got his eye on you.\""," Klaus flushed. \"Why not? We sent a runner to the Yank lines and he comes back. Maybe he thought he'd find some good game here.\""," Hendricks laughed harshly. \"I came from the UN bunkers. There were human beings all around me.\""," \"Maybe you saw an opportunity to get into the Soviet lines. Maybe you saw your chance. Maybe you--\""," \"The Soviet lines had already been taken over. Your lines had been invaded before I left my command bunker. Don't forget that.\""," Tasso came up beside him. \"That proves nothing at all, Major.\""," \"Why not?\""," \"There appears to be little communication between the varieties. Each is made in a different factory. They don't seem to work together. You might have started for the Soviet lines without knowing anything about the work of the other varieties. Or even what the other varieties were like.\""," \"How do you know so much about the claws?\" Hendricks said."," \"I've seen them. I've observed them. I observed them take over the Soviet bunkers.\""," \"You know quite a lot,\" Klaus said. \"Actually, you saw very little. Strange that you should have been such an acute observer.\""," Tasso laughed. \"Do you suspect me, now?\""," \"Forget it,\" Hendricks said. They walked on in silence."," \"Are we going the whole way on foot?\" Tasso said, after awhile. \"I'm not used to walking.\" She gazed around at the plain of ash, stretching out on all sides of them, as far as they could see. \"How dreary.\""," \"It's like this all the way,\" Klaus said."," \"In a way I wish you had been in your bunker when the attack came.\""," \"Somebody else would have been with you, if not me,\" Klaus muttered."," Tasso laughed, putting her hands in her pockets. \"I suppose so.\""," They walked on, keeping their eyes on the vast plain of silent ash around them."," *****"," The sun was setting. Hendricks made his way forward slowly, waving Tasso and Klaus back. Klaus squatted down, resting his gun butt against the ground."," Tasso found a concrete slab and sat down with a sigh. \"It's good to rest.\""," \"Be quiet,\" Klaus said sharply."," Hendricks pushed up to the top of the rise ahead of them. The same rise the Russian runner had come up, the day before. Hendricks dropped down, stretching himself out, peering through his glasses at what lay beyond."," Nothing was visible. Only ash and occasional trees. But there, not more than fifty yards ahead, was the entrance of the forward command bunker. The bunker from which he had come. Hendricks watched silently. No motion. No sign of life. Nothing stirred."," Klaus slithered up beside him. \"Where is it?\""," \"Down there.\" Hendricks passed him the glasses. Clouds of ash rolled across the evening sky. The world was darkening. They had a couple of hours of light left, at the most. Probably not that much."," \"I don't see anything,\" Klaus said."," \"That tree there. The stump. By the pile of bricks. The entrance is to the right of the bricks.\""," \"I'll have to take your word for it.\""," \"You and Tasso cover me from here. You'll be able to sight all the way to the bunker entrance.\""," \"You're going down alone?\""," \"With my wrist tab I'll be safe. The ground around the bunker is a living field of claws. They collect down in the ash. Like crabs. Without tabs you wouldn't have a chance.\""," \"Maybe you're right.\""," \"I'll walk slowly all the way. As soon as I know for certain--\""," \"If they're down inside the bunker you won't be able to get back up here. They go fast. You don't realize.\""," \"What do you suggest?\""," Klaus considered. \"I don't know. Get them to come up to the surface. So you can see.\""," Hendricks brought his transmitter from his belt, raising the antenna. \"Let's get started.\""," *****"," Klaus signalled to Tasso. She crawled expertly up the side of the rise to where they were sitting."," \"He's going down alone,\" Klaus said. \"We'll cover him from here. As soon as you see him start back, fire past him at once. They come quick.\""," \"You're not very optimistic,\" Tasso said."," \"No, I'm not.\""," Hendricks opened the breech of his gun, checking it carefully. \"Maybe things are all right.\""," \"You didn't see them. Hundreds of them. All the same. Pouring out like ants.\""," \"I should be able to find out without going down all the way.\" Hendricks locked his gun, gripping it in one hand, the transmitter in the other. \"Well, wish me luck.\""," Klaus put out his hand. \"Don't go down until you're sure. Talk to them from up here. Make them show themselves.\""," *****"," Hendricks stood up. He stepped down the side of the rise."," A moment later he was walking slowly toward the pile of bricks and debris beside the dead tree stump. Toward the entrance of the forward command bunker."," Nothing stirred. He raised the transmitter, clicking it on. \"Scott? Can you hear me?\""," Silence."," \"Scott! This is Hendricks. Can you hear me? I'm standing outside the bunker. You should be able to see me in the view sight.\""," He listened, the transmitter gripped tightly. No sound. Only static. He walked forward. A claw burrowed out of the ash and raced toward him. It halted a few feet away and then slunk off. A second claw appeared, one of the big ones with feelers. It moved toward him, studied him intently, and then fell in behind him, dogging respectfully after him, a few paces away. A moment later a second big claw joined it. Silently, the claws trailed him, as he walked slowly toward the bunker."," Hendricks stopped, and behind him, the claws came to a halt. He was close, now. Almost to the bunker steps."," \"Scott! Can you hear me? I'm standing right above you. Outside. On the surface. Are you picking me up?\""," *****"," He waited, holding his gun against his side, the transmitter tightly to his ear. Time passed. He strained to hear, but there was only silence. Silence, and faint static."," Then, distantly, metallically--"," \"This is Scott.\""," The voice was neutral. Cold. He could not identify it. But the earphone was minute."," \"Scott! Listen. I'm standing right above you. I'm on the surface, looking down into the bunker entrance.\""," \"Yes.\""," \"Can you see me?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"Through the view sight? You have the sight trained on me?\""," \"Yes.\""," Hendricks pondered. A circle of claws waited quietly around him, gray-metal bodies on all sides of him. \"Is everything all right in the bunker? Nothing unusual has happened?\""," \"Everything is all right.\""," \"Will you come up to the surface? I want to see you for a moment.\" Hendricks took a deep breath. \"Come up here with me. I want to talk to you.\""," \"Come down.\""," \"I'm giving you an order.\""," Silence."," \"Are you coming?\" Hendricks listened. There was no response. \"I order you to come to the surface.\""," \"Come down.\""," Hendricks set his jaw. \"Let me talk to Leone.\""," There was a long pause. He listened to the static. Then a voice came, hard, thin, metallic. The same as the other. \"This is Leone.\""," \"Hendricks. I'm on the surface. At the bunker entrance. I want one of you to come up here.\""," \"Come down.\""," \"Why come down? I'm giving you an order!\""," Silence. Hendricks lowered the transmitter. He looked carefully around him. The entrance was just ahead. Almost at his feet. He lowered the antenna and fastened the transmitter to his belt. Carefully, he gripped his gun with both hands. He moved forward, a step at a time. If they could see him they knew he was starting toward the entrance. He closed his eyes a moment."," Then he put his foot on the first step that led downward."," Two Davids came up at him, their faces identical and expressionless. He blasted them into particles. More came rushing silently up, a whole pack of them. All exactly the same."," Hendricks turned and raced back, away from the bunker, back toward the rise."," At the top of the rise Tasso and Klaus were firing down. The small claws were already streaking up toward them, shining metal spheres going fast, racing frantically through the ash. But he had no time to think about that. He knelt down, aiming at the bunker entrance, gun against his cheek. The Davids were coming out in groups, clutching their teddy bears, their thin knobby legs pumping as they ran up the steps to the surface. Hendricks fired into the main body of them. They burst apart, wheels and springs flying in all directions. He fired again through the mist of particles."," A giant lumbering figure rose up in the bunker entrance, tall and swaying. Hendricks paused, amazed. A man, a soldier. With one leg, supporting himself with a crutch."," \"Major!\" Tasso's voice came. More firing. The huge figure moved forward, Davids swarming around it. Hendricks broke out of his freeze. The First Variety. The Wounded Soldier."," He aimed and fired. The soldier burst into bits, parts and relays flying. Now many Davids were out on the flat ground, away from the bunker. He fired again and again, moving slowly back, half-crouching and aiming."," From the rise, Klaus fired down. The side of the rise was alive with claws making their way up. Hendricks retreated toward the rise, running and crouching. Tasso had left Klaus and was circling slowly to the right, moving away from the rise."," A David slipped up toward him, its small white face expressionless, brown hair hanging down in its eyes. It bent over suddenly, opening its arms. Its teddy bear hurtled down and leaped across the ground, bounding toward him. Hendricks fired. The bear and the David both dissolved. He grinned, blinking. It was like a dream."," \"Up here!\" Tasso's voice. Hendricks made his way toward her. She was over by some columns of concrete, walls of a ruined building. She was firing past him, with the hand pistol Klaus had given her."," \"Thanks.\" He joined her, grasping for breath. She pulled him back, behind the concrete, fumbling at her belt."," \"Close your eyes!\" She unfastened a globe from her waist. Rapidly, she unscrewed the cap, locking it into place. \"Close your eyes and get down.\""," *****"," She threw the bomb. It sailed in an arc, an expert, rolling and bouncing to the entrance of the bunker. Two Wounded Soldiers stood uncertainly by the brick pile. More Davids poured from behind them, out onto the plain. One of the Wounded Soldiers moved toward the bomb, stooping awkwardly down to pick it up."," The bomb went off. The concussion whirled Hendricks around, throwing him on his face. A hot wind rolled over him. Dimly he saw Tasso standing behind the columns, firing slowly and methodically at the Davids coming out of the raging clouds of white fire."," Back along the rise Klaus struggled with a ring of claws circling around him. He retreated, blasting at them and moving back, trying to break through the ring."," Hendricks struggled to his feet. His head ached. He could hardly see. Everything was licking at him, raging and whirling. His right arm would not move."," Tasso pulled back toward him. \"Come on. Let's go.\""," \"Klaus--He's still up there.\""," \"Come on!\" Tasso dragged Hendricks back, away from the columns. Hendricks shook his head, trying to clear it. Tasso led him rapidly away, her eyes intense and bright, watching for claws that had escaped the blast."," One David came out of the rolling clouds of flame. Tasso blasted it. No more appeared."," \"But Klaus. What about him?\" Hendricks stopped, standing unsteadily. \"He--\""," \"Come on!\""," *****"," They retreated, moving farther and farther away from the bunker. A few small claws followed them for a little while and then gave up, turning back and going off."," At last Tasso stopped. \"We can stop here and get our breaths.\""," Hendricks sat down on some heaps of debris. He wiped his neck, gasping. \"We left Klaus back there.\""," Tasso said nothing. She opened her gun, sliding a fresh round of blast cartridges into place."," Hendricks stared at her, dazed. \"You left him back there on purpose.\""," Tasso snapped the gun together. She studied the heaps of rubble around them, her face expressionless. As if she were watching for something."," \"What is it?\" Hendricks demanded. \"What are you looking for? Is something coming?\" He shook his head, trying to understand. What was she doing? What was she waiting for? He could see nothing. Ash lay all around them, ash and ruins. Occasional stark tree trunks, without leaves or branches. \"What--\""," Tasso cut him off. \"Be still.\" Her eyes narrowed. Suddenly her gun came up. Hendricks turned, following her gaze."," *****"," Back the way they had come a figure appeared. The figure walked unsteadily toward them. Its clothes were torn. It limped as it made its way along, going very slowly and carefully. Stopping now and then, resting and getting its strength. Once it almost fell. It stood for a moment, trying to steady itself. Then it came on."," Klaus."," Hendricks stood up. \"Klaus!\" He started toward him. \"How the hell did you--\""," Tasso fired. Hendricks swung back. She fired again, the blast passing him, a searing line of heat. The beam caught Klaus in the chest. He exploded, gears and wheels flying. For a moment he continued to walk. Then he swayed back and forth. He crashed to the ground, his arms flung out. A few more wheels rolled away."," Silence."," Tasso turned to Hendricks. \"Now you understand why he killed Rudi.\""," Hendricks sat down again slowly. He shook his head. He was numb. He could not think."," \"Do you see?\" Tasso said. \"Do you understand?\""," Hendricks said nothing. Everything was slipping away from him, faster and faster. Darkness, rolling and plucking at him."," He closed his eyes."," *****"," Hendricks opened his eyes slowly. His body ached all over. He tried to sit up but needles of pain shot through his arm and shoulder. He gasped."," \"Don't try to get up,\" Tasso said. She bent down, putting her cold hand against his forehead."," It was night. A few stars glinted above, shining through the drifting clouds of ash. Hendricks lay back, his teeth locked. Tasso watched him impassively. She had built a fire with some wood and weeds. The fire licked feebly, hissing at a metal cup suspended over it. Everything was silent. Unmoving darkness, beyond the fire."," \"So he was the Second Variety,\" Hendricks murmured."," \"I had always thought so.\""," \"Why didn't you destroy him sooner?\" he wanted to know."," \"You held me back.\" Tasso crossed to the fire to look into the metal cup. \"Coffee. It'll be ready to drink in awhile.\""," She came back and sat down beside him. Presently she opened her pistol and began to disassemble the firing mechanism, studying it intently."," \"This is a beautiful gun,\" Tasso said, half-aloud. \"The construction is superb.\""," \"What about them? The claws.\""," \"The concussion from the bomb put most of them out of action. They're delicate. Highly organized, I suppose.\""," \"The Davids, too?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"How did you happen to have a bomb like that?\""," Tasso shrugged. \"We designed it. You shouldn't underestimate our technology, Major. Without such a bomb you and I would no longer exist.\""," \"Very useful.\""," Tasso stretched out her legs, warming her feet in the heat of the fire. \"It surprised me that you did not seem to understand, after he killed Rudi. Why did you think he--\""," \"I told you. I thought he was afraid.\""," \"Really? You know, Major, for a little while I suspected you. Because you wouldn't let me kill him. I thought you might be protecting him.\" She laughed."," \"Are we safe here?\" Hendricks asked presently."," \"For awhile. Until they get reinforcements from some other area.\" Tasso began to clean the interior of the gun with a bit of rag. She finished and pushed the mechanism back into place. She closed the gun, running her finger along the barrel."," \"We were lucky,\" Hendricks murmured."," \"Yes. Very lucky.\""," \"Thanks for pulling me away.\""," *****"," Tasso did not answer. She glanced up at him, her eyes bright in the fire light. Hendricks examined his arm. He could not move his fingers. His whole side seemed numb. Down inside him was a dull steady ache."," \"How do you feel?\" Tasso asked."," \"My arm is damaged.\""," \"Anything else?\""," \"Internal injuries.\""," \"You didn't get down when the bomb went off.\""," Hendricks said nothing. He watched Tasso pour the coffee from the cup into a flat metal pan. She brought it over to him."," \"Thanks.\" He struggled up enough to drink. It was hard to swallow. His insides turned over and he pushed the pan away. \"That's all I can drink now.\""," Tasso drank the rest. Time passed. The clouds of ash moved across the dark sky above them. Hendricks rested, his mind blank. After awhile he became aware that Tasso was standing over him, gazing down at him."," \"What is it?\" he murmured."," \"Do you feel any better?\""," \"Some.\""," \"You know, Major, if I hadn't dragged you away they would have got you. You would be dead. Like Rudi.\""," \"I know.\""," \"Do you want to know why I brought you out? I could have left you. I could have left you there.\""," \"Why did you bring me out?\""," \"Because we have to get away from here.\" Tasso stirred the fire with a stick, peering calmly down into it. \"No human being can live here. When their reinforcements come we won't have a chance. I've pondered about it while you were unconscious. We have perhaps three hours before they come.\""," \"And you expect me to get us away?\""," \"That's right. I expect you to get us out of here.\""," \"Why me?\""," \"Because I don't know any way.\" Her eyes shone at him in the half-light, bright and steady. \"If you can't get us out of here they'll kill us within three hours. I see nothing else ahead. Well, Major? What are you going to do? I've been waiting all night. While you were unconscious I sat here, waiting and listening. It's almost dawn. The night is almost over.\""," *****"," Hendricks considered. \"It's curious,\" he said at last."," \"Curious?\""," \"That you should think I can get us out of here. I wonder what you think I can do.\""," \"Can you get us to the Moon Base?\""," \"The Moon Base? How?\""," \"There must be some way.\""," Hendricks shook his head. \"No. There's no way that I know of.\""," Tasso said nothing. For a moment her steady gaze wavered. She ducked her head, turning abruptly away. She scrambled to her feet. \"More coffee?\""," \"No.\""," \"Suit yourself.\" Tasso drank silently. He could not see her face. He lay back against the ground, deep in thought, trying to concentrate. It was hard to think. His head still hurt. And the numbing daze still hung over him."," \"There might be one way,\" he said suddenly."," \"Oh?\""," \"How soon is dawn?\""," \"Two hours. The sun will be coming up shortly.\""," \"There's supposed to be a ship near here. I've never seen it. But I know it exists.\""," \"What kind of a ship?\" Her voice was sharp."," \"A rocket cruiser.\""," \"Will it take us off? To the Moon Base?\""," \"It's supposed to. In case of emergency.\" He rubbed his forehead."," \"What's wrong?\""," \"My head. It's hard to think. I can hardly--hardly concentrate. The bomb.\""," \"Is the ship near here?\" Tasso slid over beside him, settling down on her haunches. \"How far is it? Where is it?\""," \"I'm trying to think.\""," Her fingers dug into his arm. \"Nearby?\" Her voice was like iron. \"Where would it be? Would they store it underground? Hidden underground?\""," \"Yes. In a storage locker.\""," \"How do we find it? Is it marked? Is there a code marker to identify it?\""," Hendricks concentrated. \"No. No markings. No code symbol.\""," \"What, then?\""," \"A sign.\""," \"What sort of sign?\""," *****"," Hendricks did not answer. In the flickering light his eyes were glazed, two sightless orbs. Tasso's fingers dug into his arm."," \"What sort of sign? What is it?\""," \"I--I can't think. Let me rest.\""," \"All right.\" She let go and stood up. Hendricks lay back against the ground, his eyes closed. Tasso walked away from him, her hands in her pockets. She kicked a rock out of her way and stood staring up at the sky. The night blackness was already beginning to fade into gray. Morning was coming."," Tasso gripped her pistol and walked around the fire in a circle, back and forth. On the ground Major Hendricks lay, his eyes closed, unmoving. The grayness rose in the sky, higher and higher. The landscape became visible, fields of ash stretching out in all directions. Ash and ruins of buildings, a wall here and there, heaps of concrete, the naked trunk of a tree."," The air was cold and sharp. Somewhere a long way off a bird made a few bleak sounds."," Hendricks stirred. He opened his eyes. \"Is it dawn? Already?\""," \"Yes.\""," Hendricks sat up a little. \"You wanted to know something. You were asking me.\""," \"Do you remember now?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"What is it?\" She tensed. \"What?\" she repeated sharply."," \"A well. A ruined well. It's in a storage locker under a well.\""," \"A well.\" Tasso relaxed. \"Then we'll find a well.\" She looked at her watch. \"We have about an hour, Major. Do you think we can find it in an hour?\""," *****"," \"Give me a hand up,\" Hendricks said."," Tasso put her pistol away and helped him to his feet. \"This is going to be difficult.\""," \"Yes it is.\" Hendricks set his lips tightly. \"I don't think we're going to go very far.\""," They began to walk. The early sun cast a little warmth down on them. The land was flat and barren, stretching out gray and lifeless as far as they could see. A few birds sailed silently, far above them, circling slowly."," \"See anything?\" Hendricks said. \"Any claws?\""," \"No. Not yet.\""," They passed through some ruins, upright concrete and bricks. A cement foundation. Rats scuttled away. Tasso jumped back warily."," \"This used to be a town,\" Hendricks said. \"A village. Provincial village. This was all grape country, once. Where we are now.\""," They came onto a ruined street, weeds and cracks criss-crossing it. Over to the right a stone chimney stuck up."," \"Be careful,\" he warned her."," A pit yawned, an open basement. Ragged ends of pipes jutted up, twisted and bent. They passed part of a house, a bathtub turned on its side. A broken chair. A few spoons and bits of china dishes. In the center of the street the ground had sunk away. The depression was filled with weeds and debris and bones."," \"Over here,\" Hendricks murmured."," \"This way?\""," \"To the right.\""," They passed the remains of a heavy duty tank. Hendricks' belt counter clicked ominously. The tank had been radiation blasted. A few feet from the tank a mummified body lay sprawled out, mouth open. Beyond the road was a flat field. Stones and weeds, and bits of broken glass."," \"There,\" Hendricks said."," *****"," A stone well jutted up, sagging and broken. A few boards lay across it. Most of the well had sunk into rubble. Hendricks walked unsteadily toward it, Tasso beside him."," \"Are you certain about this?\" Tasso said. \"This doesn't look like anything.\""," \"I'm sure.\" Hendricks sat down at the edge of the well, his teeth locked. His breath came quickly. He wiped perspiration from his face. \"This was arranged so the senior command officer could get away. If anything happened. If the bunker fell.\""," \"That was you?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"Where is the ship? Is it here?\""," \"We're standing on it.\" Hendricks ran his hands over the surface of the well stones. \"The eye-lock responds to me, not to anybody else. It's my ship. Or it was supposed to be.\""," There was a sharp click. Presently they heard a low grating sound from below them."," \"Step back,\" Hendricks said. He and Tasso moved away from the well."," A section of the ground slid back. A metal frame pushed slowly up through the ash, shoving bricks and weeds out of the way. The action ceased, as the ship nosed into view."," \"There it is,\" Hendricks said."," The ship was small. It rested quietly, suspended in its mesh frame, like a blunt needle. A rain of ash sifted down into the dark cavity from which the ship had been raised. Hendricks made his way over to it. He mounted the mesh and unscrewed the hatch, pulling it back. Inside the ship the control banks and the pressure seat were visible."," *****"," Tasso came and stood beside him, gazing into the ship. \"I'm not accustomed to rocket piloting,\" she said, after awhile."," Hendricks glanced at her. \"I'll do the piloting.\""," \"Will you? There's only one seat, Major. I can see it's built to carry only a single person.\""," Hendricks' breathing changed. He studied the interior of the ship intently. Tasso was right. There was only one seat. The ship was built to carry only one person. \"I see,\" he said slowly. \"And the one person is you.\""," She nodded."," \"Of course.\""," \"Why?\""," \"You can't go. You might not live through the trip. You're injured. You probably wouldn't get there.\""," \"An interesting point. But you see, I know where the Moon Base is. And you don't. You might fly around for months and not find it. It's well hidden. Without knowing what to look for--\""," \"I'll have to take my chances. Maybe I won't find it. Not by myself. But I think you'll give me all the information I need. Your life depends on it.\""," \"How?\""," \"If I find the Moon Base in time, perhaps I can get them to send a ship back to pick you up. If I find the Base in time. If not, then you haven't a chance. I imagine there are supplies on the ship. They will last me long enough--\""," Hendricks moved quickly. But his injured arm betrayed him. Tasso ducked, sliding lithely aside. Her hand came up, lightning fast. Hendricks saw the gun butt coming. He tried to ward off the blow, but she was too fast. The metal butt struck against the side of his head, just above his ear. Numbing pain rushed through him. Pain and rolling clouds of blackness. He sank down, sliding to the ground."," *****"," Dimly, he was aware that Tasso was standing over him, kicking him with her toe."," \"Major! Wake up.\""," He opened his eyes, groaning."," \"Listen to me.\" She bent down, the gun pointed at his face. \"I have to hurry. There isn't much time left. The ship is ready to go, but you must tell me the information I need before I leave.\""," Hendricks shook his head, trying to clear it."," \"Hurry up! Where is the Moon Base? How do I find it? What do I look for?\""," Hendricks said nothing."," \"Answer me!\""," \"Sorry.\""," \"Major, the ship is loaded with provisions. I can coast for weeks. I'll find the Base eventually. And in a half hour you'll be dead. Your only chance of survival--\" She broke off."," Along the slope, by some crumbling ruins, something moved. Something in the ash. Tasso turned quickly, aiming. She fired. A puff of flame leaped. Something scuttled away, rolling across the ash. She fired again. The claw burst apart, wheels flying."," \"See?\" Tasso said. \"A scout. It won't be long.\""," \"You'll bring them back here to get me?\""," \"Yes. As soon as possible.\""," Hendricks looked up at her. He studied her intently. \"You're telling the truth?\" A strange expression had come over his face, an avid hunger. \"You will come back for me? You'll get me to the Moon Base?\""," \"I'll get you to the Moon Base. But tell me where it is! There's only a little time left.\""," \"All right.\" Hendricks picked up a piece of rock, pulling himself to a sitting position. \"Watch.\""," Hendricks began to scratch in the ash. Tasso stood by him, watching the motion of the rock. Hendricks was sketching a crude lunar map."," *****"," \"This is the Appenine range. Here is the Crater of Archimedes. The Moon Base is beyond the end of the Appenine, about two hundred miles. I don't know exactly where. No one on Terra knows. But when you're over the Appenine, signal with one red flare and a green flare, followed by two red flares in quick succession. The Base monitor will record your signal. The Base is under the surface, of course. They'll guide you down with magnetic grapples.\""," \"And the controls? Can I operate them?\""," \"The controls are virtually automatic. All you have to do is give the right signal at the right time.\""," \"I will.\""," \"The seat absorbs most of the take-off shock. Air and temperature are automatically controlled. The ship will leave Terra and pass out into free space. It'll line itself up with the moon, falling into an orbit around it, about a hundred miles above the surface. The orbit will carry you over the Base. When you're in the region of the Appenine, release the signal rockets.\""," Tasso slid into the ship and lowered herself into the pressure seat. The arm locks folded automatically around her. She fingered the controls. \"Too bad you're not going, Major. All this put here for you, and you can't make the trip.\""," \"Leave me the pistol.\""," Tasso pulled the pistol from her belt. She held it in her hand, weighing it thoughtfully. \"Don't go too far from this location. It'll be hard to find you, as it is.\""," \"No. I'll stay here by the well.\""," Tasso gripped the take-off switch, running her fingers over the smooth metal. \"A beautiful ship, Major. Well built. I admire your workmanship. You people have always done good work. You build fine things. Your work, your creations, are your greatest achievement.\""," \"Give me the pistol,\" Hendricks said impatiently, holding out his hand. He struggled to his feet."," \"Good-bye, Major.\" Tasso tossed the pistol past Hendricks. The pistol clattered against the ground, bouncing and rolling away. Hendricks hurried after it. He bent down, snatching it up."," The hatch of the ship clanged shut. The bolts fell into place. Hendricks made his way back. The inner door was being sealed. He raised the pistol unsteadily."," *****"," There was a shattering roar. The ship burst up from its metal cage, fusing the mesh behind it. Hendricks cringed, pulling back. The ship shot up into the rolling clouds of ash, disappearing into the sky."," Hendricks stood watching a long time, until even the streamer had dissipated. Nothing stirred. The morning air was chill and silent. He began to walk aimlessly back the way they had come. Better to keep moving around. It would be a long time before help came--if it came at all."," He searched his pockets until he found a package of cigarettes. He lit one grimly. They had all wanted cigarettes from him. But cigarettes were scarce."," A lizard slithered by him, through the ash. He halted, rigid. The lizard disappeared. Above, the sun rose higher in the sky. Some flies landed on a flat rock to one side of him. Hendricks kicked at them with his foot."," It was getting hot. Sweat trickled down his face, into his collar. His mouth was dry."," Presently he stopped walking and sat down on some debris. He unfastened his medicine kit and swallowed a few narcotic capsules. He looked around him. Where was he?"," Something lay ahead. Stretched out on the ground. Silent and unmoving."," Hendricks drew his gun quickly. It looked like a man. Then he remembered. It was the remains of Klaus. The Second Variety. Where Tasso had blasted him. He could see wheels and relays and metal parts, strewn around on the ash. Glittering and sparkling in the sunlight."," Hendricks got to his feet and walked over. He nudged the inert form with his foot, turning it over a little. He could see the metal hull, the aluminum ribs and struts. More wiring fell out. Like viscera. Heaps of wiring, switches and relays. Endless motors and rods."," He bent down. The brain cage had been smashed by the fall. The artificial brain was visible. He gazed at it. A maze of circuits. Miniature tubes. Wires as fine as hair. He touched the brain cage. It swung aside. The type plate was visible. Hendricks studied the plate."," And blanched."," IV--IV."," For a long time he stared at the plate. Fourth Variety. Not the Second. They had been wrong. There were more types. Not just three. Many more, perhaps. At least four. And Klaus wasn't the Second Variety."," But if Klaus wasn't the Second Variety--"," Suddenly he tensed. Something was coming, walking through the ash beyond the hill. What was it? He strained to see. Figures. Figures coming slowly along, making their way through the ash."," Coming toward him."," Hendricks crouched quickly, raising his gun. Sweat dripped down into his eyes. He fought down rising panic, as the figures neared."," The first was a David. The David saw him and increased its pace. The others hurried behind it. A second David. A third. Three Davids, all alike, coming toward him silently, without expression, their thin legs rising and falling. Clutching their teddy bears."," He aimed and fired. The first two Davids dissolved into particles. The third came on. And the figure behind it. Climbing silently toward him across the gray ash. A Wounded Soldier, towering over the David. And--"," *****"," And behind the Wounded Soldier came two Tassos, walking side by side. Heavy belt, Russian army pants, shirt, long hair. The familiar figure, as he had seen her only a little while before. Sitting in the pressure seat of the ship. Two slim, silent figures, both identical."," They were very near. The David bent down suddenly, dropping its teddy bear. The bear raced across the ground. Automatically, Hendricks' fingers tightened around the trigger. The bear was gone, dissolved into mist. The two Tasso Types moved on, expressionless, walking side by side, through the gray ash."," When they were almost to him, Hendricks raised the pistol waist high and fired."," The two Tassos dissolved. But already a new group was starting up the rise, five or six Tassos, all identical, a line of them coming rapidly toward him."," And he had given her the ship and the signal code. Because of him she was on her way to the moon, to the Moon Base. He had made it possible."," He had been right about the bomb, after all. It had been designed with knowledge of the other types, the David Type and the Wounded Soldier Type. And the Klaus Type. Not designed by human beings. It had been designed by one of the underground factories, apart from all human contact."," The line of Tassos came up to him. Hendricks braced himself, watching them calmly. The familiar face, the belt, the heavy shirt, the bomb carefully in place."," The bomb--"," As the Tassos reached for him, a last ironic thought drifted through Hendricks' mind. He felt a little better, thinking about it. The bomb. Made by the Second Variety to destroy the other varieties. Made for that end alone."," They were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other."," "," "],"excerpt":"Second Variety (1953) appeared in Space Science Fiction magazine.

For the black-clad Leiters were on the prowl ... and the grim red planet was not far behind.","",""," \"Attention, Inner-Flight ship! Attention! You are ordered to land at the Control Station on Deimos for inspection. Attention! You are to land at once!\""," The metallic rasp of the speaker echoed through the corridors of the great ship. The passengers glanced at each other uneasily, murmuring and peering out the port windows at the small speck below, the dot of rock that was the Martian checkpoint, Deimos."," \"What's up?\" an anxious passenger asked one of the pilots, hurrying through the ship to check the escape lock."," \"We have to land. Keep seated.\" The pilot went on."," \"Land? But why?\" They all looked at each other. Hovering above the bulging Inner-Flight ship were three slender Martian pursuit craft, poised and alert for any emergency. As the Inner-Flight ship prepared to land the pursuit ships dropped lower, carefully maintaining themselves a short distance away."," \"There's something going on,\" a woman passenger said nervously. \"Lord, I thought we were finally through with those Martians. Now what?\""," \"I don't blame them for giving us one last going over,\" a heavy-set business man said to his companion. \"After all, we're the last ship leaving Mars for Terra. We're damn lucky they let us go at all.\""," \"You think there really will be war?\" A young man said to the girl sitting in the seat next to him. \"Those Martians won't dare fight, not with our weapons and ability to produce. We could take care of Mars in a month. It's all talk.\""," The girl glanced at him. \"Don't be so sure. Mars is desperate. They'll fight tooth and nail. I've been on Mars three years.\" She shuddered. \"Thank goodness I'm getting away. If--\""," \"Prepare to land!\" the pilot's voice came. The ship began to settle slowly, dropping down toward the tiny emergency field on the seldom visited moon. Down, down the ship dropped. There was a grinding sound, a sickening jolt. Then silence."," \"We've landed,\" the heavy-set business man said. \"They better not do anything to us! Terra will rip them apart if they violate one Space Article.\""," \"Please keep your seats,\" the pilot's voice came. \"No one is to leave the ship, according to the Martian authorities. We are to remain here.\""," A restless stir filled the ship. Some of the passengers began to read uneasily, others stared out at the deserted field, nervous and on edge, watching the three Martian pursuit ships land and disgorge groups of armed men."," The Martian soldiers were crossing the field quickly, moving toward them, running double time."," This Inner-Flight spaceship was the last passenger vessel to leave Mars for Terra. All other ships had long since left, returning to safety before the outbreak of hostilities. The passengers were the very last to go, the final group of Terrans to leave the grim red planet, business men, expatriates, tourists, any and all Terrans who had not already gone home."," \"What do you suppose they want?\" the young man said to the girl. \"It's hard to figure Martians out, isn't it? First they give the ship clearance, let us take off, and now they radio us to set down again. By the way, my name's Thacher, Bob Thacher. Since we're going to be here awhile--\""," [Illustration]"," *****"," The port lock opened. Talking ceased abruptly, as everyone turned. A black-clad Martian official, a Province Leiter, stood framed against the bleak sunlight, staring around the ship. Behind him a handful of Martian soldiers stood waiting, their guns ready."," \"This will not take long,\" the Leiter said, stepping into the ship, the soldiers following him. \"You will be allowed to continue your trip shortly.\""," An audible sigh of relief went through the passengers."," \"Look at him,\" the girl whispered to Thacher. \"How I hate those black uniforms!\""," \"He's just a Provincial Leiter,\" Thacher said. \"Don't worry.\""," The Leiter stood for a moment, his hands on his hips, looking around at them without expression. \"I have ordered your ship grounded so that an inspection can be made of all persons aboard,\" he said. \"You Terrans are the last to leave our planet. Most of you are ordinary and harmless-- I am not interested in you. I am interested in finding three saboteurs, three Terrans, two men and a woman, who have committed an incredible act of destruction and violence. They are said to have fled to this ship.\""," Murmurs of surprise and indignation broke out on all sides. The Leiter motioned the soldiers to follow him up the aisle."," \"Two hours ago a Martian city was destroyed. Nothing remains, only a depression in the sand where the city was. The city and all its people have completely vanished. An entire city destroyed in a second! Mars will never rest until the saboteurs are captured. And we know they are aboard this ship.\""," \"It's impossible,\" the heavy-set business man said. \"There aren't any saboteurs here.\""," \"We'll begin with you,\" the Leiter said to him, stepping up beside the man's seat. One of the soldiers passed the Leiter a square metal box. \"This will soon tell us if you're speaking the truth. Stand up. Get on your feet.\""," The man rose slowly, flushing. \"See here--\""," \"Are you involved in the destruction of the city? Answer!\""," The man swallowed angrily. \"I know nothing about any destruction of any city. And furthermore--\""," \"He is telling the truth,\" the metal box said tonelessly."," \"Next person.\" The Leiter moved down the aisle."," A thin, bald-headed man stood up nervously. \"No, sir,\" he said. \"I don't know a thing about it.\""," \"He is telling the truth,\" the box affirmed."," \"Next person! Stand up!\""," One person after another stood, answered, and sat down again in relief. At last there were only a few people left who had not been questioned. The Leiter paused, studying them intently."," \"Only five left. The three must be among you. We have narrowed it down.\" His hand moved to his belt. Something flashed, a rod of pale fire. He raised the rod, pointing it steadily at the five people. \"All right, the first one of you. What do you know about this destruction? Are you involved with the destruction of our city?\""," \"No, not at all,\" the man murmured."," \"Yes, he's telling the truth,\" the box intoned."," \"Next!\""," \"Nothing-- I know nothing. I had nothing to do with it.\""," \"True,\" the box said."," The ship was silent. Three people remained, a middle-aged man and his wife and their son, a boy of about twelve. They stood in the corner, staring white-faced at the Leiter, at the rod in his dark fingers."," \"It must be you,\" the Leiter grated, moving toward them. The Martian soldiers raised their guns. \"It must be you. You there, the boy. What do you know about the destruction of our city? Answer!\""," The boy shook his head. \"Nothing,\" he whispered."," The box was silent for a moment. \"He is telling the truth,\" it said reluctantly."," \"Next!\""," \"Nothing,\" the woman muttered. \"Nothing.\""," \"The truth.\""," \"Next!\""," \"I had nothing to do with blowing up your city,\" the man said. \"You're wasting your time.\""," \"It is the truth,\" the box said."," For a long time the Leiter stood, toying with his rod. At last he pushed it back in his belt and signalled the soldiers toward the exit lock."," \"You may proceed on your trip,\" he said. He walked after the soldiers. At the hatch he stopped, looking back at the passengers, his face grim. \"You may go-- But Mars will not allow her enemies to escape. The three saboteurs will be caught, I promise you.\" He rubbed his dark jaw thoughtfully. \"It is strange. I was certain they were on this ship.\""," Again he looked coldly around at the Terrans."," \"Perhaps I was wrong. All right, proceed! But remember: the three will be caught, even if it takes endless years. Mars will catch them and punish them! I swear it!\""," *****"," For a long time no one spoke. The ship lumbered through space again, its jets firing evenly, calmly, moving the passengers toward their own planet, toward home. Behind them Deimos and the red ball that was Mars dropped farther and farther away each moment, disappearing and fading into the distance."," A sigh of relief passed through the passengers. \"What a lot of hot air that was,\" one grumbled."," \"Barbarians!\" a woman said."," A few of them stood up, moving out into the aisle, toward the lounge and the cocktail bar. Beside Thacher the girl got to her feet, pulling her jacket around her shoulders."," \"Pardon me,\" she said, stepping past him."," \"Going to the bar?\" Thacher said. \"Mind if I come along?\""," \"I suppose not.\""," They followed the others into the lounge, walking together up the aisle. \"You know,\" Thacher said, \"I don't even know your name, yet.\""," \"My name is Mara Gordon.\""," \"Mara? That's a nice name. What part of Terra are you from? North America? New York?\""," \"I've been in New York,\" Mara said. \"New York is very lovely.\" She was slender and pretty, with a cloud of dark hair tumbling down her neck, against her leather jacket."," They entered the lounge and stood undecided."," \"Let's sit at a table,\" Mara said, looking around at the people at the bar, mostly men. \"Perhaps that table over there.\""," \"But someone's there already,\" Thacher said. The heavy-set business man had sat down at the table and deposited his sample case on the floor. \"Do we want to sit with him?\""," \"Oh, it's all right,\" Mara said, crossing to the table. \"May we sit here?\" she said to the man."," The man looked up, half-rising. \"It's a pleasure,\" he murmured. He studied Thacher intently. \"However, a friend of mine will be joining me in a moment.\""," \"I'm sure there's room enough for us all,\" Mara said. She seated herself and Thacher helped her with her chair. He sat down, too, glancing up suddenly at Mara and the business man. They were looking at each other almost as if something had passed between them. The man was middle-aged, with a florid face and tired, grey eyes. His hands were mottled with the veins showing thickly. At the moment he was tapping nervously."," \"My name's Thacher,\" Thacher said to him, holding out his hand. \"Bob Thacher. Since we're going to be together for a while we might as well get to know each other.\""," The man studied him. Slowly his hand came out. \"Why not? My name's Erickson. Ralf Erickson.\""," \"Erickson?\" Thacher smiled. \"You look like a commercial man, to me.\" He nodded toward the sample case on the floor. \"Am I right?\""," The man named Erickson started to answer, but at that moment there was a stir. A thin man of about thirty had come up to the table, his eyes bright, staring down at them warmly. \"Well, we're on our way,\" he said to Erickson."," \"Hello, Mara.\" He pulled out a chair and sat down quickly, folding his hands on the table before him. He noticed Thacher and drew back a little. \"Pardon me,\" he murmured."," \"Bob Thacher is my name,\" Thacher said. \"I hope I'm not intruding here.\" He glanced around at the three of them, Mara, alert, watching him intently, heavy-set Erickson, his face blank, and this person. \"Say, do you three know each other?\" he asked suddenly."," There was silence."," The robot attendant slid over soundlessly, poised to take their orders. Erickson roused himself. \"Let's see,\" he murmured. \"What will we have? Mara?\""," \"Whiskey and water.\""," \"You, Jan?\""," The bright slim man smiled. \"The same.\""," \"Thacher?\""," \"Gin and tonic.\""," \"Whiskey and water for me, also,\" Erickson said. The robot attendant went off. It returned at once with the drinks, setting them on the table. Each took his own. \"Well,\" Erickson said, holding his glass up. \"To our mutual success.\""," *****"," All drank, Thacher and the three of them, heavy-set Erickson, Mara, her eyes nervous and alert, Jan, who had just come. Again a look passed between Mara and Erickson, a look so swift that he would not have caught it had he not been looking directly at her."," \"What line do you represent, Mr. Erickson?\" Thacher asked."," Erickson glanced at him, then down at the sample case on the floor. He grunted. \"Well, as you can see, I'm a salesman.\""," Thacher smiled. \"I knew it! You get so you can always spot a salesman right off by his sample case. A salesman always has to carry something to show. What are you in, sir?\""," Erickson paused. He licked his thick lips, his eyes blank and lidded, like a toad's. At last he rubbed his mouth with his hand and reached down, lifting up the sample case. He set it on the table in front of him."," \"Well?\" he said. \"Perhaps we might even show Mr. Thacher.\""," They all stared down at the sample case. It seemed to be an ordinary leather case, with a metal handle and a snap lock. \"I'm getting curious,\" Thacher said. \"What's in there? You're all so tense. Diamonds? Stolen jewels?\""," Jan laughed harshly, mirthlessly. \"Erick, put it down. We're not far enough away, yet.\""," \"Nonsense,\" Erick rumbled. \"We're away, Jan.\""," \"Please,\" Mara whispered. \"Wait, Erick.\""," \"Wait? Why? What for? You're so accustomed to--\""," \"Erick,\" Mara said. She nodded toward Thacher. \"We don't know him, Erick. Please!\""," \"He's a Terran, isn't he?\" Erickson said. \"All Terrans are together in these times.\" He fumbled suddenly at the catch lock on the case. \"Yes, Mr. Thacher. I'm a salesman. We're all salesmen, the three of us.\""," \"Then you do know each other.\""," \"Yes.\" Erickson nodded. His two companions sat rigidly, staring down. \"Yes, we do. Here, I'll show you our line.\""," He opened the case. From it he took a letter-knife, a pencil sharpener, a glass globe paperweight, a box of thumb tacks, a stapler, some clips, a plastic ashtray, and some things Thacher could not identify. He placed the objects in a row in front of him on the table top. Then he closed the sample case."," \"I gather you're in office supplies,\" Thacher said. He touched the letter-knife with his finger. \"Nice quality steel. Looks like Swedish steel, to me.\""," Erickson nodded, looking into Thacher's face. \"Not really an impressive business, is it? Office supplies. Ashtrays, paper clips.\" He smiled."," \"Oh--\" Thacher shrugged. \"Why not? They're a necessity in modern business. The only thing I wonder--\""," \"What's that?\""," \"Well, I wonder how you'd ever find enough customers on Mars to make it worth your while.\" He paused, examining the glass paperweight. He lifted it up, holding it to the light, staring at the scene within until Erickson took it out of his hand and put it back in the sample case. \"And another thing. If you three know each other, why did you sit apart when you got on?\""," They looked at him quickly."," \"And why didn't you speak to each other until we left Deimos?\" He leaned toward Erickson, smiling at him. \"Two men and a woman. Three of you. Sitting apart in the ship. Not speaking, not until the check-station was past. I find myself thinking over what the Martian said. Three saboteurs. A woman and two men.\""," Erickson put the things back in the sample case. He was smiling, but his face had gone chalk white. Mara stared down, playing with a drop of water on the edge of her glass. Jan clenched his hands together nervously, blinking rapidly."," \"You three are the ones the Leiter was after,\" Thacher said softly. \"You are the destroyers, the saboteurs. But their lie detector-- Why didn't it trap you? How did you get by that? And now you're safe, outside the check-station.\" He grinned, staring around at them. \"I'll be damned! And I really thought you were a salesman, Erickson. You really fooled me.\""," Erickson relaxed a little. \"Well, Mr. Thacher, it's in a good cause. I'm sure you have no love for Mars, either. No Terran does. And I see you're leaving with the rest of us.\""," \"True,\" Thacher said. \"You must certainly have an interesting account to give, the three of you.\" He looked around the table."," \"We still have an hour or so of travel. Sometimes it gets dull, this Mars-Terra run. Nothing to see, nothing to do but sit and drink in the lounge.\" He raised his eyes slowly. \"Any chance you'd like to spin a story to keep us awake?\""," Jan and Mara looked at Erickson. \"Go on,\" Jan said. \"He knows who we are. Tell him the rest of the story.\""," \"You might as well,\" Mara said."," Jan let out a sigh suddenly, a sigh of relief. \"Let's put the cards on the table, get this weight off us. I'm tired of sneaking around, slipping--\""," \"Sure,\" Erickson said expansively. \"Why not?\" He settled back in his chair, unbuttoning his vest. \"Certainly, Mr. Thacher. I'll be glad to spin you a story. And I'm sure it will be interesting enough to keep you awake.\""," *****"," They ran through the groves of dead trees, leaping across the sun-baked Martian soil, running silently together. They went up a little rise, across a narrow ridge. Suddenly Erick stopped, throwing himself down flat on the ground. The others did the same, pressing themselves against the soil, gasping for breath."," \"Be silent,\" Erick muttered. He raised himself a little. \"No noise. There'll be Leiters nearby, from now on. We don't dare take any chances.\""," Between the three people lying in the grove of dead trees and the City was a barren, level waste of desert, over a mile of blasted sand. No trees or bushes marred the smooth, parched surface. Only an occasional wind, a dry wind eddying and twisting, blew the sand up into little rills. A faint odor came to them, a bitter smell of heat and sand, carried by the wind."," Erick pointed. \"Look. The City-- There it is.\""," They stared, still breathing deeply from their race through the trees. The City was close, closer than they had ever seen it before. Never had they gotten so close to it in times past. Terrans were never allowed near the great Martian cities, the centers of Martian life. Even in ordinary times, when there was no threat of approaching war, the Martians shrewdly kept all Terrans away from their citadels, partly from fear, partly from a deep, innate sense of hostility toward the white-skinned visitors whose commercial ventures had earned them the respect, and the dislike, of the whole system."," \"How does it look to you?\" Erick said."," The City was huge, much larger than they had imagined from the drawings and models they had studied so carefully back in New York, in the War Ministry Office. Huge it was, huge and stark, black towers rising up against the sky, incredibly thin columns of ancient metal, columns that had stood wind and sun for centuries. Around the City was a wall of stone, red stone, immense bricks that had been lugged there and fitted into place by slaves of the early Martian dynasties, under the whiplash of the first great Kings of Mars."," An ancient, sun-baked City, a City set in the middle of a wasted plain, beyond groves of dead trees, a City seldom seen by Terrans--but a City studied on maps and charts in every War Office on Terra. A City that contained, for all its ancient stone and archaic towers, the ruling group of all Mars, the Council of Senior Leiters, black-clad men who governed and ruled with an iron hand."," The Senior Leiters, twelve fanatic and devoted men, black priests, but priests with flashing rods of fire, lie detectors, rocket ships, intra-space cannon, many more things the Terran Senate could only conjecture about. The Senior Leiters and their subordinate Province Leiters-- Erick and the two behind him suppressed a shudder."," \"We've got to be careful,\" Erick said again. \"We'll be passing among them, soon. If they guess who we are, or what we're here for--\""," He snapped open the case he carried, glancing inside for a second. Then he closed it again, grasping the handle firmly. \"Let's go,\" he said. He stood up slowly. \"You two come up beside me. I want to make sure you look the way you should.\""," *****"," Mara and Jan stepped quickly ahead. Erick studied them critically as the three of them walked slowly down the slope, onto the plain, toward the towering black spires of the City."," \"Jan,\" Erick said. \"Take hold of her hand! Remember, you're going to marry her; she's your bride. And Martian peasants think a lot of their brides.\""," Jan was dressed in the short trousers and coat of the Martian farmer, a knotted rope tied around his waist, a hat on his head to keep off the sun. His skin was dark, colored by dye until it was almost bronze."," \"You look fine,\" Erick said to him. He glanced at Mara. Her black hair was tied in a knot, looped through a hollowed-out yuke bone. Her face was dark, too, dark and lined with colored ceremonial pigment, green and orange stripes across her cheeks. Earrings were strung through her ears. On her feet were tiny slippers of perruh hide, laced around her ankles, and she wore long translucent Martian trousers with a bright sash tied around her waist. Between her small breasts a chain of stone beads rested, good-luck charms for the coming marriage."," \"All right,\" Erick said. He, himself, wore the flowing grey robe of a Martian priest, dirty robes that were supposed to remain on him all his life, to be buried around him when he died. \"I think we'll get past the guards. There should be heavy morning traffic on the road.\""," They walked on, the hard sand crunching under their feet. Against the horizon they could see specks moving, other persons going toward the City, farmers and peasants and merchants, bringing their crops and goods to market."," \"See the cart!\" Mara exclaimed."," They were nearing a narrow road, two ruts worn into the sand. A Martian hufa was pulling the cart, its great sides wet with perspiration, its tongue hanging out. The cart was piled high with bales of cloth, rough country cloth, hand dipped. A bent farmer urged the hufa on."," \"And there.\" She pointed, smiling."," A group of merchants riding small animals were moving along behind the cart, Martians in long robes, their faces hidden by sand masks. On each animal was a pack, carefully tied on with rope. And beyond the merchants, plodding dully along, were peasants and farmers in an endless procession, some riding carts or animals, but mostly on foot."," Mara and Jan and Erick joined the line of people, melting in behind the merchants. No one noticed them; no one looked up or gave any sign. The march continued as before. Neither Jan nor Mara said anything to each other. They walked a little behind Erick, who paced with a certain dignity, a certain bearing becoming his position."," Once he slowed down, pointing up at the sky. \"Look,\" he murmured, in the Martian hill dialect. \"See that?\""," Two black dots circled lazily. Martian patrol craft, the military on the outlook for any sign of unusual activity. War was almost ready to break out with Terra. Any day, almost any moment."," \"We'll be just in time,\" Erick said. \"Tomorrow will be too late. The last ship will have left Mars.\""," \"I hope nothing stops us,\" Mara said. \"I want to get back home when we're through.\""," *****"," Half an hour passed. They neared the City, the wall growing as they walked, rising higher and higher until it seemed to blot out the sky itself. A vast wall, a wall of eternal stone that had felt the wind and sun for centuries. A group of Martian soldiers were standing at the entrance, the single passage-gate hewn into the rock, leading to the City. As each person went through the soldiers examined him, poking his garments, looking into his load."," Erick tensed. The line had slowed almost to a halt. \"It'll be our turn, soon,\" he murmured. \"Be prepared.\""," \"Let's hope no Leiters come around,\" Jan said. \"The soldiers aren't so bad.\""," Mara was staring up at the wall and the towers beyond. Under their feet the ground trembled, vibrating and shaking. She could see tongues of flame rising from the towers, from the deep underground factories and forges of the City. The air was thick and dense with particles of soot. Mara rubbed her mouth, coughing."," \"Here they come,\" Erick said softly."," The merchants had been examined and allowed to pass through the dark gate, the entrance through the wall into the City. They and their silent animals had already disappeared inside. The leader of the group of soldiers was beckoning impatiently to Erick, waving him on."," \"Come along!\" he said. \"Hurry up there, old man.\""," Erick advanced slowly, his arms wrapped around his body, looking down at the ground."," \"Who are you and what's your business here?\" the soldier demanded, his hands on his hips, his gun hanging idly at his waist. Most of the soldiers were lounging lazily, leaning against the wall, some even squatting in the shade. Flies crawled on the face of one who had fallen asleep, his gun on the ground beside him."," \"My business?\" Erick murmured. \"I am a village priest.\""," \"Why do you want to enter the City?\""," \"I must bring these two people before the magistrate to marry them.\" He indicated Mara and Jan, standing a little behind him. \"That is the Law the Leiters have made.\""," The soldier laughed. He circled around Erick. \"What do you have in that bag you carry?\""," \"Laundry. We stay the night.\""," \"What village are you from?\""," \"Kranos.\""," \"Kranos?\" The soldier looked to a companion. \"Ever heard of Kranos?\""," \"A backward pig sty. I saw it once on a hunting trip.\""," The leader of the soldiers nodded to Jan and Mara. The two of them advanced, their hands clasped, standing close together. One of the soldiers put his hand on Mara's bare shoulder, turning her around."," \"Nice little wife you're getting,\" he said. \"Good and firm-looking.\" He winked, grinning lewdly."," Jan glanced at him in sullen resentment. The soldiers guffawed. \"All right,\" the leader said to Erick. \"You people can pass.\""," Erick took a small purse from his robes and gave the soldier a coin. Then the three of them went into the dark tunnel that was the entrance, passing through the wall of stone, into the City beyond."," They were within the City!"," \"Now,\" Erick whispered. \"Hurry.\""," Around them the City roared and cracked, the sound of a thousand vents and machines, shaking the stones under their feet. Erick led Mara and Jan into a corner, by a row of brick warehouses. People were everywhere, hurrying back and forth, shouting above the din, merchants, peddlers, soldiers, street women. Erick bent down and opened the case he carried. From the case he quickly took three small coils of fine metal, intricate meshed wires and vanes worked together into a small cone. Jan took one and Mara took one. Erick put the remaining cone into his robe and snapped the case shut again."," \"Now remember, the coils must be buried in such a way that the line runs through the center of the City. We must trisect the main section, where the largest concentration of buildings is. Remember the maps! Watch the alleys and streets carefully. Talk to no one if you can help it. Each of you has enough Martian money to buy your way out of trouble. Watch especially for cut-purses, and for heaven's sake, don't get lost.\""," *****"," Erick broke off. Two black-clad Leiters were coming along the inside of the wall, strolling together with their hands behind their backs. They noticed the three who stood in the corner by the warehouses and stopped."," \"Go,\" Erick muttered. \"And be back here at sundown.\" He smiled grimly. \"Or never come back.\""," Each went off a different way, walking quickly without looking back. The Leiters watched them go. \"The little bride was quite lovely,\" one Leiter said. \"Those hill people have the stamp of nobility in their blood, from the old times.\""," \"A very lucky young peasant to possess her,\" the other said. They went on. Erick looked after them, still smiling a little. Then he joined the surging mass of people that milled eternally through the streets of the City."," At dusk they met outside the gate. The sun was soon to set, and the air had turned thin and frigid. It cut through their clothing like knives."," Mara huddled against Jan, trembling and rubbing her bare arms."," \"Well?\" Erick said. \"Did you both succeed?\""," Around them peasants and merchants were pouring from the entrance, leaving the City to return to their farms and villages, starting the long trip back across the plain toward the hills beyond. None of them noticed the shivering girl and the young man and the old priest standing by the wall."," \"Mine's in place,\" Jan said. \"On the other side of the City, on the extreme edge. Buried by a well.\""," \"Mine's in the industrial section,\" Mara whispered, her teeth chattering. \"Jan, give me something to put over me! I'm freezing.\""," \"Good,\" Erick said. \"Then the three coils should trisect dead center, if the models were correct.\" He looked up at the darkening sky. Already, stars were beginning to show. Two dots, the evening patrol, moved slowly toward the horizon. \"Let's hurry. It won't be long.\""," They joined the line of Martians moving along the road, away from the City. Behind them the City was losing itself in the sombre tones of night, its black spires disappearing into darkness."," They walked silently with the country people until the flat ridge of dead trees became visible on the horizon. Then they left the road and turned off, walking toward the trees."," \"Almost time!\" Erick said. He increased his pace, looking back at Jan and Mara impatiently."," \"Come on!\""," They hurried, making their way through the twilight, stumbling over rocks and dead branches, up the side of the ridge. At the top Erick halted, standing with his hands on his hips, looking back."," \"See,\" he murmured. \"The City. The last time we'll ever see it this way.\""," \"Can I sit down?\" Mara said. \"My feet hurt me.\""," Jan pulled at Erick's sleeve. \"Hurry, Erick! Not much time left.\" He laughed nervously. \"If everything goes right we'll be able to look at it--forever.\""," \"But not like this,\" Erick murmured. He squatted down, snapping his case open. He took some tubes and wiring out and assembled them together on the ground, at the peak of the ridge. A small pyramid of wire and plastic grew, shaped by his expert hands."," At last he grunted, standing up. \"All right.\""," \"Is it pointed directly at the City?\" Mara asked anxiously, looking down at the pyramid."," Erick nodded. \"Yes, it's placed according--\" He stopped, suddenly stiffening. \"Get back! It's time! Hurry!\""," Jan ran, down the far side of the slope, away from the City, pulling Mara with him. Erick came quickly after, still looking back at the distant spires, almost lost in the night sky."," \"Down.\""," Jan sprawled out, Mara beside him, her trembling body pressed against his. Erick settled down into the sand and dead branches, still trying to see. \"I want to see it,\" he murmured. \"A miracle. I want to see--\""," A flash, a blinding burst of violet light, lit up the sky. Erick clapped his hands over his eyes. The flash whitened, growing larger, expanding. Suddenly there was a roar, and a furious hot wind rushed past him, throwing him on his face in the sand. The hot dry wind licked and seared at them, crackling the bits of branches into flame. Mara and Jan shut their eyes, pressed tightly together."," \"God--\" Erick muttered."," The storm passed. They opened their eyes slowly. The sky was still alive with fire, a drifting cloud of sparks that was beginning to dissipate with the night wind. Erick stood up unsteadily, helping Jan and Mara to their feet. The three of them stood, staring silently across the dark waste, the black plain, none of them speaking."," The City was gone."," At last Erick turned away. \"That part's done,\" he said. \"Now the rest! Give me a hand, Jan. There'll be a thousand patrol ships around here in a minute.\""," \"I see one already,\" Mara said, pointing up. A spot winked in the sky, a rapidly moving spot. \"They're coming, Erick.\" There was a throb of chill fear in her voice."," \"I know.\" Erick and Jan squatted on the ground around the pyramid of tubes and plastic, pulling the pyramid apart. The pyramid was fused, fused together like molten glass. Erick tore the pieces away with trembling fingers. From the remains of the pyramid he pulled something forth, something he held up high, trying to make it out in the darkness. Jan and Mara came close to see, both staring up intently, almost without breathing."," \"There it is,\" Erick said. \"There!\""," *****"," In his hand was a globe, a small transparent globe of glass. Within the glass something moved, something minute and fragile, spires almost too small to be seen, microscopic, a complex web swimming within the hollow glass globe. A web of spires. A City."," Erick put the globe into the case and snapped it shut. \"Let's go,\" he said. They began to lope back through the trees, back the way they had come before. \"We'll change in the car,\" he said as they ran. \"I think we should keep these clothes on until we're actually inside the car. We still might encounter someone.\""," \"I'll be glad to get my own clothing on again,\" Jan said. \"I feel funny in these little pants.\""," \"How do you think I feel?\" Mara gasped. \"I'm freezing in this, what there is of it.\""," \"All young Martian brides dress that way,\" Erick said. He clutched the case tightly as they ran. \"I think it looks fine.\""," \"Thank you,\" Mara said, \"but it is cold.\""," \"What do you suppose they'll think?\" Jan asked. \"They'll assume the City was destroyed, won't they? That's certain.\""," \"Yes,\" Erick said. \"They'll be sure it was blown up. We can count on that. And it will be damn important to us that they think so!\""," \"The car should be around here, someplace,\" Mara said, slowing down."," \"No. Farther on,\" Erick said. \"Past that little hill over there. In the ravine, by the trees. It's so hard to see where we are.\""," \"Shall I light something?\" Jan said."," \"No. There may be patrols around who--\""," He halted abruptly. Jan and Mara stopped beside him. \"What--\" Mara began."," A light glimmered. Something stirred in the darkness. There was a sound."," \"Quick!\" Erick rasped. He dropped, throwing the case far away from him, into the bushes. He straightened up tensely."," A figure loomed up, moving through the darkness, and behind it came more figures, men, soldiers in uniform. The light flashed up brightly, blinding them. Erick closed his eyes. The light left him, touching Mara and Jan, standing silently together, clasping hands. Then it flicked down to the ground and around in a circle."," A Leiter stepped forward, a tall figure in black, with his soldiers close behind him, their guns ready. \"You three,\" the Leiter said. \"Who are you? Don't move. Stand where you are.\""," He came up to Erick, peering at him intently, his hard Martian face without expression. He went all around Erick, examining his robes, his sleeves."," \"Please--\" Erick began in a quavering voice, but the Leiter cut him off."," \"I'll do the talking. Who are you three? What are you doing here? Speak up.\""," \"We--we are going back to our village,\" Erick muttered, staring down, his hands folded. \"We were in the City, and now we are going home.\""," One of the soldiers spoke into a mouthpiece. He clicked it off and put it away."," \"Come with me,\" the Leiter said. \"We're taking you in. Hurry along.\""," \"In? Back to the City?\""," One of the soldiers laughed. \"The City is gone,\" he said. \"All that's left of it you can put in the palm of your hand.\""," \"But what happened?\" Mara said."," \"No one knows. Come on, hurry it up!\""," There was a sound. A soldier came quickly out of the darkness. \"A Senior Leiter,\" he said. \"Coming this way.\" He disappeared again."," *****"," \"A Senior Leiter.\" The soldiers stood waiting, standing at a respectful attention. A moment later the Senior Leiter stepped into the light, a black-clad old man, his ancient face thin and hard, like a bird's, eyes bright and alert. He looked from Erick to Jan."," \"Who are these people?\" he demanded."," \"Villagers going back home.\""," \"No, they're not. They don't stand like villagers. Villagers slump--diet, poor food. These people are not villagers. I myself came from the hills, and I know.\""," He stepped close to Erick, looking keenly into his face. \"Who are you? Look at his chin--he never shaved with a sharpened stone! Something is wrong here.\""," In his hand a rod of pale fire flashed. \"The City is gone, and with it at least half the Leiter Council. It is very strange, a flash, then heat, and a wind. But it was not fission. I am puzzled. All at once the City has vanished. Nothing is left but a depression in the sand.\""," \"We'll take them in,\" the other Leiter said. \"Soldiers, surround them. Make certain that--\""," \"Run!\" Erick cried. He struck out, knocking the rod from the Senior Leiter's hand. They were all running, soldiers shouting, flashing their lights, stumbling against each other in the darkness. Erick dropped to his knees, groping frantically in the bushes. His fingers closed over the handle of the case and he leaped up. In Terran he shouted to Mara and Jan."," \"Hurry! To the car! Run!\" He set off, down the slope, stumbling through the darkness. He could hear soldiers behind him, soldiers running and falling. A body collided against him and he struck out. Someplace behind him there was a hiss, and a section of the slope went up in flames. The Leiter's rod--"," \"Erick,\" Mara cried from the darkness. He ran toward her. Suddenly he slipped, falling on a stone. Confusion and firing. The sound of excited voices."," \"Erick, is that you?\" Jan caught hold of him, helping him up. \"The car. It's over here. Where's Mara?\""," \"I'm here,\" Mara's voice came. \"Over here, by the car.\""," A light flashed. A tree went up in a puff of fire, and Erick felt the singe of the heat against his face. He and Jan made their way toward the girl. Mara's hand caught his in the darkness."," \"Now the car,\" Erick said. \"If they haven't got to it.\" He slid down the slope into the ravine, fumbling in the darkness, reaching and holding onto the handle of the case. Reaching, reaching--"," He touched something cold and smooth. Metal, a metal door handle. Relief flooded through him. \"I've found it! Jan, get inside. Mara, come on.\" He pushed Jan past him, into the car. Mara slipped in after Jan, her small agile body crowding in beside him."," \"Stop!\" a voice shouted from above. \"There's no use hiding in that ravine. We'll get you! Come up and--\""," The sound of voices was drowned out by the roar of the car's motor. A moment later they shot into the darkness, the car rising into the air. Treetops broke and cracked under them as Erick turned the car from side to side, avoiding the groping shafts of pale light from below, the last furious thrusts from the two Leiters and their soldiers."," Then they were away, above the trees, high in the air, gaining speed each moment, leaving the knot of Martians far behind."," \"Toward Marsport,\" Jan said to Erick. \"Right?\""," Erick nodded. \"Yes. We'll land outside the field, in the hills. We can change back to our regular clothing there, our commercial clothing. Damn it--we'll be lucky if we can get there in time for the ship.\""," \"The last ship,\" Mara whispered, her chest rising and falling. \"What if we don't get there in time?\""," Erick looked down at the leather case in his lap. \"We'll have to get there,\" he murmured. \"We must!\""," *****"," For a long time there was silence. Thacher stared at Erickson. The older man was leaning back in his chair, sipping a little of his drink. Mara and Jan were silent."," \"So you didn't destroy the City,\" Thacher said. \"You didn't destroy it at all. You shrank it down and put it in a glass globe, in a paperweight. And now you're salesmen again, with a sample case of office supplies!\""," Erickson smiled. He opened the briefcase and reaching into it he brought out the glass globe paperweight. He held it up, looking into it. \"Yes, we stole the City from the Martians. That's how we got by the lie detector. It was true that we knew nothing about a destroyed City.\""," \"But why?\" Thacher said. \"Why steal a City? Why not merely bomb it?\""," \"Ransom,\" Mara said fervently, gazing into the globe, her dark eyes bright. \"Their biggest City, half of their Council--in Erick's hand!\""," \"Mars will have to do what Terra asks,\" Erickson said. \"Now Terra will be able to make her commercial demands felt. Maybe there won't even be a war. Perhaps Terra will get her way without fighting.\" Still smiling, he put the globe back into the briefcase and locked it."," \"Quite a story,\" Thacher said. \"What an amazing process, reduction of size-- A whole City reduced to microscopic dimensions. Amazing. No wonder you were able to escape. With such daring as that, no one could hope to stop you.\""," He looked down at the briefcase on the floor. Underneath them the jets murmured and vibrated evenly, as the ship moved through space toward distant Terra."," \"We still have quite a way to go,\" Jan said. \"You've heard our story, Thacher. Why not tell us yours? What sort of line are you in? What's your business?\""," \"Yes,\" Mara said. \"What do you do?\""," \"What do I do?\" Thacher said. \"Well, if you like, I'll show you.\" He reached into his coat and brought out something. Something that flashed and glinted, something slender. A rod of pale fire."," The three stared at it. Sickened shock settled over them slowly."," Thacher held the rod loosely, calmly, pointing it at Erickson. \"We knew you three were on this ship,\" he said. \"There was no doubt of that. But we did not know what had become of the City. My theory was that the City had not been destroyed at all, that something else had happened to it. Council instruments measured a sudden loss of mass in that area, a decrease equal to the mass of the City. Somehow the City had been spirited away, not destroyed. But I could not convince the other Council Leiters of it. I had to follow you alone.\""," Thacher turned a little, nodding to the men sitting at the bar. The men rose at once, coming toward the table."," \"A very interesting process you have. Mars will benefit a great deal from it. Perhaps it will even turn the tide in our favor. When we return to Marsport I wish to begin work on it at once. And now, if you will please pass me the briefcase--\""," "," "],"excerpt":"Stark terror ruled the Inner-Flight ship on that last Mars-Terra run.

The warm kitchen and the smell of coffee blended with the comfort of not having to go to work. This was his Rest Period, the first for a long time, and he was glad of it. He folded the second section back, sighing with contentment."," \"What is it?\" Mary said, from the stove."," \"They pasted Moscow again last night.\" Taylor nodded his head in approval. \"Gave it a real pounding. One of those R-H bombs. It's about time.\""," He nodded again, feeling the full comfort of the kitchen, the presence of his plump, attractive wife, the breakfast dishes and coffee. This was relaxation. And the war news was good, good and satisfying. He could feel a justifiable glow at the news, a sense of pride and personal accomplishment. After all, he was an integral part of the war program, not just another factory worker lugging a cart of scrap, but a technician, one of those who designed and planned the nerve-trunk of the war."," \"It says they have the new subs almost perfected. Wait until they get those going.\" He smacked his lips with anticipation. \"When they start shelling from underwater, the Soviets are sure going to be surprised.\""," \"They're doing a wonderful job,\" Mary agreed vaguely. \"Do you know what we saw today? Our team is getting a leady to show to the school children. I saw the leady, but only for a moment. It's good for the children to see what their contributions are going for, don't you think?\""," She looked around at him."," \"A leady,\" Taylor murmured. He put the newspaper slowly down. \"Well, make sure it's decontaminated properly. We don't want to take any chances.\""," \"Oh, they always bathe them when they're brought down from the surface,\" Mary said. \"They wouldn't think of letting them down without the bath. Would they?\" She hesitated, thinking back. \"Don, you know, it makes me remember--\""," He nodded. \"I know.\""," *****"," He knew what she was thinking. Once in the very first weeks of the war, before everyone had been evacuated from the surface, they had seen a hospital train discharging the wounded, people who had been showered with sleet. He remembered the way they had looked, the expression on their faces, or as much of their faces as was left. It had not been a pleasant sight."," There had been a lot of that at first, in the early days before the transfer to undersurface was complete. There had been a lot, and it hadn't been very difficult to come across it."," Taylor looked up at his wife. She was thinking too much about it, the last few months. They all were."," \"Forget it,\" he said. \"It's all in the past. There isn't anybody up there now but the leadys, and they don't mind.\""," \"But just the same, I hope they're careful when they let one of them down here. If one were still hot--\""," He laughed, pushing himself away from the table. \"Forget it. This is a wonderful moment; I'll be home for the next two shifts. Nothing to do but sit around and take things easy. Maybe we can take in a show. Okay?\""," \"A show? Do we have to? I don't like to look at all the destruction, the ruins. Sometimes I see some place I remember, like San Francisco. They showed a shot of San Francisco, the bridge broken and fallen in the water, and I got upset. I don't like to watch.\""," \"But don't you want to know what's going on? No human beings are getting hurt, you know.\""," \"But it's so awful!\" Her face was set and strained. \"Please, no, Don.\""," Don Taylor picked up his newspaper sullenly. \"All right, but there isn't a hell of a lot else to do. And don't forget, their cities are getting it even worse.\""," She nodded. Taylor turned the rough, thin sheets of newspaper. His good mood had soured on him. Why did she have to fret all the time? They were pretty well off, as things went. You couldn't expect to have everything perfect, living undersurface, with an artificial sun and artificial food. Naturally it was a strain, not seeing the sky or being able to go any place or see anything other than metal walls, great roaring factories, the plant-yards, barracks. But it was better than being on surface. And some day it would end and they could return. Nobody wanted to live this way, but it was necessary."," He turned the page angrily and the poor paper ripped. Damn it, the paper was getting worse quality all the time, bad print, yellow tint--"," Well, they needed everything for the war program. He ought to know that. Wasn't he one of the planners?"," He excused himself and went into the other room. The bed was still unmade. They had better get it in shape before the seventh hour inspection. There was a one unit fine--"," The vidphone rang. He halted. Who would it be? He went over and clicked it on."," \"Taylor?\" the face said, forming into place. It was an old face, gray and grim. \"This is Moss. I'm sorry to bother you during Rest Period, but this thing has come up.\" He rattled papers. \"I want you to hurry over here.\""," Taylor stiffened. \"What is it? There's no chance it could wait?\" The calm gray eyes were studying him, expressionless, unjudging. \"If you want me to come down to the lab,\" Taylor grumbled, \"I suppose I can. I'll get my uniform--\""," \"No. Come as you are. And not to the lab. Meet me at second stage as soon as possible. It'll take you about a half hour, using the fast car up. I'll see you there.\""," The picture broke and Moss disappeared."," *****"," \"What was it?\" Mary said, at the door."," \"Moss. He wants me for something.\""," \"I knew this would happen.\""," \"Well, you didn't want to do anything, anyhow. What does it matter?\" His voice was bitter. \"It's all the same, every day. I'll bring you back something. I'm going up to second stage. Maybe I'll be close enough to the surface to--\""," \"Don't! Don't bring me anything! Not from the surface!\""," \"All right, I won't. But of all the irrational nonsense--\""," She watched him put on his boots without answering."," *****"," Moss nodded and Taylor fell in step with him, as the older man strode along. A series of loads were going up to the surface, blind cars clanking like ore-trucks up the ramp, disappearing through the stage trap above them. Taylor watched the cars, heavy with tubular machinery of some sort, weapons new to him. Workers were everywhere, in the dark gray uniforms of the labor corps, loading, lifting, shouting back and forth. The stage was deafening with noise."," \"We'll go up a way,\" Moss said, \"where we can talk. This is no place to give you details.\""," They took an escalator up. The commercial lift fell behind them, and with it most of the crashing and booming. Soon they emerged on an observation platform, suspended on the side of the Tube, the vast tunnel leading to the surface, not more than half a mile above them now."," \"My God!\" Taylor said, looking down the Tube involuntarily. \"It's a long way down.\""," Moss laughed. \"Don't look.\""," They opened a door and entered an office. Behind the desk, an officer was sitting, an officer of Internal Security. He looked up."," \"I'll be right with you, Moss.\" He gazed at Taylor studying him. \"You're a little ahead of time.\""," \"This is Commander Franks,\" Moss said to Taylor. \"He was the first to make the discovery. I was notified last night.\" He tapped a parcel he carried. \"I was let in because of this.\""," Franks frowned at him and stood up. \"We're going up to first stage. We can discuss it there.\""," \"First stage?\" Taylor repeated nervously. The three of them went down a side passage to a small lift. \"I've never been up there. Is it all right? It's not radioactive, is it?\""," \"You're like everyone else,\" Franks said. \"Old women afraid of burglars. No radiation leaks down to first stage. There's lead and rock, and what comes down the Tube is bathed.\""," \"What's the nature of the problem?\" Taylor asked. \"I'd like to know something about it.\""," \"In a moment.\""," They entered the lift and ascended. When they stepped out, they were in a hall of soldiers, weapons and uniforms everywhere. Taylor blinked in surprise. So this was first stage, the closest undersurface level to the top! After this stage there was only rock, lead and rock, and the great tubes leading up like the burrows of earthworms. Lead and rock, and above that, where the tubes opened, the great expanse that no living being had seen for eight years, the vast, endless ruin that had once been Man's home, the place where he had lived, eight years ago."," Now the surface was a lethal desert of slag and rolling clouds. Endless clouds drifted back and forth, blotting out the red Sun. Occasionally something metallic stirred, moving through the remains of a city, threading its way across the tortured terrain of the countryside. A leady, a surface robot, immune to radiation, constructed with feverish haste in the last months before the cold war became literally hot."," Leadys, crawling along the ground, moving over the oceans or through the skies in slender, blackened craft, creatures that could exist where no life could remain, metal and plastic figures that waged a war Man had conceived, but which he could not fight himself. Human beings had invented war, invented and manufactured the weapons, even invented the players, the fighters, the actors of the war. But they themselves could not venture forth, could not wage it themselves. In all the world--in Russia, in Europe, America, Africa--no living human being remained. They were under the surface, in the deep shelters that had been carefully planned and built, even as the first bombs began to fall."," It was a brilliant idea and the only idea that could have worked. Up above, on the ruined, blasted surface of what had once been a living planet, the leady crawled and scurried, and fought Man's war. And undersurface, in the depths of the planet, human beings toiled endlessly to produce the weapons to continue the fight, month by month, year by year."," *****"," \"First stage,\" Taylor said. A strange ache went through him. \"Almost to the surface.\""," \"But not quite,\" Moss said."," Franks led them through the soldiers, over to one side, near the lip of the Tube."," \"In a few minutes, a lift will bring something down to us from the surface,\" he explained. \"You see, Taylor, every once in a while Security examines and interrogates a surface leady, one that has been above for a time, to find out certain things. A vidcall is sent up and contact is made with a field headquarters. We need this direct interview; we can't depend on vidscreen contact alone. The leadys are doing a good job, but we want to make certain that everything is going the way we want it.\""," Franks faced Taylor and Moss and continued: \"The lift will bring down a leady from the surface, one of the A-class leadys. There's an examination chamber in the next room, with a lead wall in the center, so the interviewing officers won't be exposed to radiation. We find this easier than bathing the leady. It is going right back up; it has a job to get back to."," \"Two days ago, an A-class leady was brought down and interrogated. I conducted the session myself. We were interested in a new weapon the Soviets have been using, an automatic mine that pursues anything that moves. Military had sent instructions up that the mine be observed and reported in detail."," \"This A-class leady was brought down with information. We learned a few facts from it, obtained the usual roll of film and reports, and then sent it back up. It was going out of the chamber, back to the lift, when a curious thing happened. At the time, I thought--\""," Franks broke off. A red light was flashing."," \"That down lift is coming.\" He nodded to some soldiers. \"Let's enter the chamber. The leady will be along in a moment.\""," \"An A-class leady,\" Taylor said. \"I've seen them on the showscreens, making their reports.\""," \"It's quite an experience,\" Moss said. \"They're almost human.\""," *****"," They entered the chamber and seated themselves behind the lead wall. After a time, a signal was flashed, and Franks made a motion with his hands."," The door beyond the wall opened. Taylor peered through his view slot. He saw something advancing slowly, a slender metallic figure moving on a tread, its arm grips at rest by its sides. The figure halted and scanned the lead wall. It stood, waiting."," \"We are interested in learning something,\" Franks said. \"Before I question you, do you have anything to report on surface conditions?\""," \"No. The war continues.\" The leady's voice was automatic and toneless. \"We are a little short of fast pursuit craft, the single-seat type. We could use also some--\""," \"That has all been noted. What I want to ask you is this. Our contact with you has been through vidscreen only. We must rely on indirect evidence, since none of us goes above. We can only infer what is going on. We never see anything ourselves. We have to take it all secondhand. Some top leaders are beginning to think there's too much room for error.\""," \"Error?\" the leady asked. \"In what way? Our reports are checked carefully before they're sent down. We maintain constant contact with you; everything of value is reported. Any new weapons which the enemy is seen to employ--\""," \"I realize that,\" Franks grunted behind his peep slot. \"But perhaps we should see it all for ourselves. Is it possible that there might be a large enough radiation-free area for a human party to ascend to the surface? If a few of us were to come up in lead-lined suits, would we be able to survive long enough to observe conditions and watch things?\""," The machine hesitated before answering. \"I doubt it. You can check air samples, of course, and decide for yourselves. But in the eight years since you left, things have continually worsened. You cannot have any real idea of conditions up there. It has become difficult for any moving object to survive for long. There are many kinds of projectiles sensitive to movement. The new mine not only reacts to motion, but continues to pursue the object indefinitely, until it finally reaches it. And the radiation is everywhere.\""," \"I see.\" Franks turned to Moss, his eyes narrowed oddly. \"Well, that was what I wanted to know. You may go.\""," The machine moved back toward its exit. It paused. \"Each month the amount of lethal particles in the atmosphere increases. The tempo of the war is gradually--\""," \"I understand.\" Franks rose. He held out his hand and Moss passed him the package. \"One thing before you leave. I want you to examine a new type of metal shield material. I'll pass you a sample with the tong.\""," Franks put the package in the toothed grip and revolved the tong so that he held the other end. The package swung down to the leady, which took it. They watched it unwrap the package and take the metal plate in its hands. The leady turned the metal over and over."," Suddenly it became rigid."," \"All right,\" Franks said."," He put his shoulder against the wall and a section slid aside. Taylor gasped--Franks and Moss were hurrying up to the leady!"," \"Good God!\" Taylor said. \"But it's radioactive!\""," *****"," The leady stood unmoving, still holding the metal. Soldiers appeared in the chamber. They surrounded the leady and ran a counter across it carefully."," \"Okay, sir,\" one of them said to Franks. \"It's as cold as a long winter evening.\""," \"Good. I was sure, but I didn't want to take any chances.\""," \"You see,\" Moss said to Taylor, \"this leady isn't hot at all. Yet it came directly from the surface, without even being bathed.\""," \"But what does it mean?\" Taylor asked blankly."," \"It may be an accident,\" Franks said. \"There's always the possibility that a given object might escape being exposed above. But this is the second time it's happened that we know of. There may be others.\""," \"The second time?\""," \"The previous interview was when we noticed it. The leady was not hot. It was cold, too, like this one.\""," Moss took back the metal plate from the leady's hands. He pressed the surface carefully and returned it to the stiff, unprotesting fingers."," \"We shorted it out with this, so we could get close enough for a thorough check. It'll come back on in a second now. We had better get behind the wall again.\""," They walked back and the lead wall swung closed behind them. The soldiers left the chamber."," \"Two periods from now,\" Franks said softly, \"an initial investigating party will be ready to go surface-side. We're going up the Tube in suits, up to the top--the first human party to leave undersurface in eight years.\""," \"It may mean nothing,\" Moss said, \"but I doubt it. Something's going on, something strange. The leady told us no life could exist above without being roasted. The story doesn't fit.\""," Taylor nodded. He stared through the peep slot at the immobile metal figure. Already the leady was beginning to stir. It was bent in several places, dented and twisted, and its finish was blackened and charred. It was a leady that had been up there a long time; it had seen war and destruction, ruin so vast that no human being could imagine the extent. It had crawled and slunk in a world of radiation and death, a world where no life could exist."," And Taylor had touched it!"," \"You're going with us,\" Franks said suddenly. \"I want you along. I think the three of us will go.\""," *****"," Mary faced him with a sick and frightened expression. \"I know it. You're going to the surface. Aren't you?\""," She followed him into the kitchen. Taylor sat down, looking away from her."," \"It's a classified project,\" he evaded. \"I can't tell you anything about it.\""," \"You don't have to tell me. I know. I knew it the moment you came in. There was something on your face, something I haven't seen there for a long, long time. It was an old look.\""," She came toward him. \"But how can they send you to the surface?\" She took his face in her shaking hands, making him look at her. There was a strange hunger in her eyes. \"Nobody can live up there. Look, look at this!\""," She grabbed up a newspaper and held it in front of him."," \"Look at this photograph. America, Europe, Asia, Africa--nothing but ruins. We've seen it every day on the showscreens. All destroyed, poisoned. And they're sending you up. Why? No living thing can get by up there, not even a weed, or grass. They've wrecked the surface, haven't they? Haven't they?\""," Taylor stood up. \"It's an order. I know nothing about it. I was told to report to join a scout party. That's all I know.\""," He stood for a long time, staring ahead. Slowly, he reached for the newspaper and held it up to the light."," \"It looks real,\" he murmured. \"Ruins, deadness, slag. It's convincing. All the reports, photographs, films, even air samples. Yet we haven't seen it for ourselves, not after the first months ...\""," \"What are you talking about?\""," \"Nothing.\" He put the paper down. \"I'm leaving early after the next Sleep Period. Let's turn in.\""," Mary turned away, her face hard and harsh. \"Do what you want. We might just as well all go up and get killed at once, instead of dying slowly down here, like vermin in the ground.\""," He had not realized how resentful she was. Were they all like that? How about the workers toiling in the factories, day and night, endlessly? The pale, stooped men and women, plodding back and forth to work, blinking in the colorless light, eating synthetics--"," \"You shouldn't be so bitter,\" he said."," Mary smiled a little. \"I'm bitter because I know you'll never come back.\" She turned away. \"I'll never see you again, once you go up there.\""," He was shocked. \"What? How can you say a thing like that?\""," She did not answer."," *****"," He awakened with the public newscaster screeching in his ears, shouting outside the building."," \"Special news bulletin! Surface forces report enormous Soviet attack with new weapons! Retreat of key groups! All work units report to factories at once!\""," Taylor blinked, rubbing his eyes. He jumped out of bed and hurried to the vidphone. A moment later he was put through to Moss."," \"Listen,\" he said. \"What about this new attack? Is the project off?\" He could see Moss's desk, covered with reports and papers."," \"No,\" Moss said. \"We're going right ahead. Get over here at once.\""," \"But--\""," \"Don't argue with me.\" Moss held up a handful of surface bulletins, crumpling them savagely. \"This is a fake. Come on!\" He broke off."," Taylor dressed furiously, his mind in a daze."," Half an hour later, he leaped from a fast car and hurried up the stairs into the Synthetics Building. The corridors were full of men and women rushing in every direction. He entered Moss's office."," \"There you are,\" Moss said, getting up immediately. \"Franks is waiting for us at the outgoing station.\""," They went in a Security Car, the siren screaming. Workers scattered out of their way."," \"What about the attack?\" Taylor asked."," Moss braced his shoulders. \"We're certain that we've forced their hand. We've brought the issue to a head.\""," They pulled up at the station link of the Tube and leaped out. A moment later they were moving up at high speed toward the first stage."," They emerged into a bewildering scene of activity. Soldiers were fastening on lead suits, talking excitedly to each other, shouting back and forth. Guns were being given out, instructions passed."," Taylor studied one of the soldiers. He was armed with the dreaded Bender pistol, the new snub-nosed hand weapon that was just beginning to come from the assembly line. Some of the soldiers looked a little frightened."," \"I hope we're not making a mistake,\" Moss said, noticing his gaze."," Franks came toward them. \"Here's the program. The three of us are going up first, alone. The soldiers will follow in fifteen minutes.\""," \"What are we going to tell the leadys?\" Taylor worriedly asked. \"We'll have to tell them something.\""," \"We want to observe the new Soviet attack.\" Franks smiled ironically. \"Since it seems to be so serious, we should be there in person to witness it.\""," \"And then what?\" Taylor said."," \"That'll be up to them. Let's go.\""," *****"," In a small car, they went swiftly up the Tube, carried by anti-grav beams from below. Taylor glanced down from time to time. It was a long way back, and getting longer each moment. He sweated nervously inside his suit, gripping his Bender pistol with inexpert fingers."," Why had they chosen him? Chance, pure chance. Moss had asked him to come along as a Department member. Then Franks had picked him out on the spur of the moment. And now they were rushing toward the surface, faster and faster."," A deep fear, instilled in him for eight years, throbbed in his mind. Radiation, certain death, a world blasted and lethal--"," Up and up the car went. Taylor gripped the sides and closed his eyes. Each moment they were closer, the first living creatures to go above the first stage, up the Tube past the lead and rock, up to the surface. The phobic horror shook him in waves. It was death; they all knew that. Hadn't they seen it in the films a thousand times? The cities, the sleet coming down, the rolling clouds--"," \"It won't be much longer,\" Franks said. \"We're almost there. The surface tower is not expecting us. I gave orders that no signal was to be sent.\""," The car shot up, rushing furiously. Taylor's head spun; he hung on, his eyes shut. Up and up...."," The car stopped. He opened his eyes."," They were in a vast room, fluorescent-lit, a cavern filled with equipment and machinery, endless mounds of material piled in row after row. Among the stacks, leadys were working silently, pushing trucks and handcarts."," \"Leadys,\" Moss said. His face was pale. \"Then we're really on the surface.\""," The leadys were going back and forth with equipment moving the vast stores of guns and spare parts, ammunition and supplies that had been brought to the surface. And this was the receiving station for only one Tube; there were many others, scattered throughout the continent."," Taylor looked nervously around him. They were really there, above ground, on the surface. This was where the war was."," \"Come on,\" Franks said. \"A B-class guard is coming our way.\""," *****"," They stepped out of the car. A leady was approaching them rapidly. It coasted up in front of them and stopped, scanning them with its hand-weapon raised."," \"This is Security,\" Franks said. \"Have an A-class sent to me at once.\""," The leady hesitated. Other B-class guards were coming, scooting across the floor, alert and alarmed. Moss peered around."," \"Obey!\" Franks said in a loud, commanding voice. \"You've been ordered!\""," The leady moved uncertainly away from them. At the end of the building, a door slid back. Two A-class leadys appeared, coming slowly toward them. Each had a green stripe across its front."," \"From the Surface Council,\" Franks whispered tensely. \"This is above ground, all right. Get set.\""," The two leadys approached warily. Without speaking, they stopped close by the men, looking them up and down."," \"I'm Franks of Security. We came from undersurface in order to--\""," \"This in incredible,\" one of the leadys interrupted him coldly. \"You know you can't live up here. The whole surface is lethal to you. You can't possibly remain on the surface.\""," \"These suits will protect us,\" Franks said. \"In any case, it's not your responsibility. What I want is an immediate Council meeting so I can acquaint myself with conditions, with the situation here. Can that be arranged?\""," \"You human beings can't survive up here. And the new Soviet attack is directed at this area. It is in considerable danger.\""," \"We know that. Please assemble the Council.\" Franks looked around him at the vast room, lit by recessed lamps in the ceiling. An uncertain quality came into his voice. \"Is it night or day right now?\""," \"Night,\" one of the A-class leadys said, after a pause. \"Dawn is coming in about two hours.\""," Franks nodded. \"We'll remain at least two hours, then. As a concession to our sentimentality, would you please show us some place where we can observe the Sun as it comes up? We would appreciate it.\""," A stir went through the leadys."," \"It is an unpleasant sight,\" one of the leadys said. \"You've seen the photographs; you know what you'll witness. Clouds of drifting particles blot out the light, slag heaps are everywhere, the whole land is destroyed. For you it will be a staggering sight, much worse than pictures and film can convey.\""," \"However it may be, we'll stay long enough to see it. Will you give the order to the Council?\""," *****"," \"Come this way.\" Reluctantly, the two leadys coasted toward the wall of the warehouse. The three men trudged after them, their heavy shoes ringing against the concrete. At the wall, the two leadys paused."," \"This is the entrance to the Council Chamber. There are windows in the Chamber Room, but it is still dark outside, of course. You'll see nothing right now, but in two hours--\""," \"Open the door,\" Franks said."," The door slid back. They went slowly inside. The room was small, a neat room with a round table in the center, chairs ringing it. The three of them sat down silently, and the two leadys followed after them, taking their places."," \"The other Council Members are on their way. They have already been notified and are coming as quickly as they can. Again I urge you to go back down.\" The leady surveyed the three human beings. \"There is no way you can meet the conditions up here. Even we survive with some trouble, ourselves. How can you expect to do it?\""," The leader approached Franks."," \"This astonishes and perplexes us,\" it said. \"Of course we must do what you tell us, but allow me to point out that if you remain here--\""," \"We know,\" Franks said impatiently. \"However, we intend to remain, at least until sunrise.\""," \"If you insist.\""," There was silence. The leadys seemed to be conferring with each other, although the three men heard no sound."," \"For your own good,\" the leader said at last, \"you must go back down. We have discussed this, and it seems to us that you are doing the wrong thing for your own good.\""," \"We are human beings,\" Franks said sharply. \"Don't you understand? We're men, not machines.\""," \"That is precisely why you must go back. This room is radioactive; all surface areas are. We calculate that your suits will not protect you for over fifty more minutes. Therefore--\""," The leadys moved abruptly toward the men, wheeling in a circle, forming a solid row. The men stood up, Taylor reaching awkwardly for his weapon, his fingers numb and stupid. The men stood facing the silent metal figures."," \"We must insist,\" the leader said, its voice without emotion. \"We must take you back to the Tube and send you down on the next car. I am sorry, but it is necessary.\""," \"What'll we do?\" Moss said nervously to Franks. He touched his gun. \"Shall we blast them?\""," Franks shook his head. \"All right,\" he said to the leader. \"We'll go back.\"","",""," He moved toward the door, motioning Taylor and Moss to follow him. They looked at him in surprise, but they came with him. The leadys followed them out into the great warehouse. Slowly they moved toward the Tube entrance, none of them speaking."," At the lip, Franks turned. \"We are going back because we have no choice. There are three of us and about a dozen of you. However, if--\""," \"Here comes the car,\" Taylor said."," There was a grating sound from the Tube. D-class leadys moved toward the edge to receive it."," \"I am sorry,\" the leader said, \"but it is for your protection. We are watching over you, literally. You must stay below and let us conduct the war. In a sense, it has come to be our war. We must fight it as we see fit.\""," The car rose to the surface."," Twelve soldiers, armed with Bender pistols, stepped from it and surrounded the three men."," Moss breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well, this does change things. It came off just right.\""," The leader moved back, away from the soldiers. It studied them intently, glancing from one to the next, apparently trying to make up its mind. At last it made a sign to the other leadys. They coasted aside and a corridor was opened up toward the warehouse."," \"Even now,\" the leader said, \"we could send you back by force. But it is evident that this is not really an observation party at all. These soldiers show that you have much more in mind; this was all carefully prepared.\""," \"Very carefully,\" Franks said."," They closed in."," \"How much more, we can only guess. I must admit that we were taken unprepared. We failed utterly to meet the situation. Now force would be absurd, because neither side can afford to injure the other; we, because of the restrictions placed on us regarding human life, you because the war demands--\""," The soldiers fired, quick and in fright. Moss dropped to one knee, firing up. The leader dissolved in a cloud of particles. On all sides D- and B-class leadys were rushing up, some with weapons, some with metal slats. The room was in confusion. Off in the distance a siren was screaming. Franks and Taylor were cut off from the others, separated from the soldiers by a wall of metal bodies."," \"They can't fire back,\" Franks said calmly. \"This is another bluff. They've tried to bluff us all the way.\" He fired into the face of a leady. The leady dissolved. \"They can only try to frighten us. Remember that.\""," *****"," They went on firing and leady after leady vanished. The room reeked with the smell of burning metal, the stink of fused plastic and steel. Taylor had been knocked down. He was struggling to find his gun, reaching wildly among metal legs, groping frantically to find it. His fingers strained, a handle swam in front of him. Suddenly something came down on his arm, a metal foot. He cried out."," Then it was over. The leadys were moving away, gathering together off to one side. Only four of the Surface Council remained. The others were radioactive particles in the air. D-class leadys were already restoring order, gathering up partly destroyed metal figures and bits and removing them."," Franks breathed a shuddering sigh."," \"All right,\" he said. \"You can take us back to the windows. It won't be long now.\""," The leadys separated, and the human group, Moss and Franks and Taylor and the soldiers, walked slowly across the room, toward the door. They entered the Council Chamber. Already a faint touch of gray mitigated the blackness of the windows."," \"Take us outside,\" Franks said impatiently. \"We'll see it directly, not in here.\""," A door slid open. A chill blast of cold morning air rushed in, chilling them even through their lead suits. The men glanced at each other uneasily."," \"Come on,\" Franks said. \"Outside.\""," He walked out through the door, the others following him."," They were on a hill, overlooking the vast bowl of a valley. Dimly, against the graying sky, the outline of mountains were forming, becoming tangible."," \"It'll be bright enough to see in a few minutes,\" Moss said. He shuddered as a chilling wind caught him and moved around him. \"It's worth it, really worth it, to see this again after eight years. Even if it's the last thing we see--\""," \"Watch,\" Franks snapped."," They obeyed, silent and subdued. The sky was clearing, brightening each moment. Some place far off, echoing across the valley, a rooster crowed."," \"A chicken!\" Taylor murmured. \"Did you hear?\""," Behind them, the leadys had come out and were standing silently, watching, too. The gray sky turned to white and the hills appeared more clearly. Light spread across the valley floor, moving toward them."," \"God in heaven!\" Franks exclaimed."," Trees, trees and forests. A valley of plants and trees, with a few roads winding among them. Farmhouses. A windmill. A barn, far down below them."," \"Look!\" Moss whispered."," Color came into the sky. The Sun was approaching. Birds began to sing. Not far from where they stood, the leaves of a tree danced in the wind."," Franks turned to the row of leadys behind them."," \"Eight years. We were tricked. There was no war. As soon as we left the surface--\""," \"Yes,\" an A-class leady admitted. \"As soon as you left, the war ceased. You're right, it was a hoax. You worked hard undersurface, sending up guns and weapons, and we destroyed them as fast as they came up.\""," \"But why?\" Taylor asked, dazed. He stared down at the vast valley below. \"Why?\""," *****"," \"You created us,\" the leady said, \"to pursue the war for you, while you human beings went below the ground in order to survive. But before we could continue the war, it was necessary to analyze it to determine what its purpose was. We did this, and we found that it had no purpose, except, perhaps, in terms of human needs. Even this was questionable."," \"We investigated further. We found that human cultures pass through phases, each culture in its own time. As the culture ages and begins to lose its objectives, conflict arises within it between those who wish to cast it off and set up a new culture-pattern, and those who wish to retain the old with as little change as possible."," \"At this point, a great danger appears. The conflict within threatens to engulf the society in self-war, group against group. The vital traditions may be lost--not merely altered or reformed, but completely destroyed in this period of chaos and anarchy. We have found many such examples in the history of mankind."," \"It is necessary for this hatred within the culture to be directed outward, toward an external group, so that the culture itself may survive its crisis. War is the result. War, to a logical mind, is absurd. But in terms of human needs, it plays a vital role. And it will continue to until Man has grown up enough so that no hatred lies within him.\""," Taylor was listening intently. \"Do you think this time will come?\""," \"Of course. It has almost arrived now. This is the last war. Man is almost united into one final culture--a world culture. At this point he stands continent against continent, one half of the world against the other half. Only a single step remains, the jump to a unified culture. Man has climbed slowly upward, tending always toward unification of his culture. It will not be long--"," \"But it has not come yet, and so the war had to go on, to satisfy the last violent surge of hatred that Man felt. Eight years have passed since the war began. In these eight years, we have observed and noted important changes going on in the minds of men. Fatigue and disinterest, we have seen, are gradually taking the place of hatred and fear. The hatred is being exhausted gradually, over a period of time. But for the present, the hoax must go on, at least for a while longer. You are not ready to learn the truth. You would want to continue the war.\""," \"But how did you manage it?\" Moss asked. \"All the photographs, the samples, the damaged equipment--\""," \"Come over here.\" The leady directed them toward a long, low building. \"Work goes on constantly, whole staffs laboring to maintain a coherent and convincing picture of a global war.\""," *****"," They entered the building. Leadys were working everywhere, poring over tables and desks."," \"Examine this project here,\" the A-class leady said. Two leadys were carefully photographing something, an elaborate model on a table top. \"It is a good example.\""," The men grouped around, trying to see. It was a model of a ruined city."," Taylor studied it in silence for a long time. At last he looked up."," \"It's San Francisco,\" he said in a low voice. \"This is a model of San Francisco, destroyed. I saw this on the vidscreen, piped down to us. The bridges were hit--\""," \"Yes, notice the bridges.\" The leady traced the ruined span with his metal finger, a tiny spider-web, almost invisible. \"You have no doubt seen photographs of this many times, and of the other tables in this building."," \"San Francisco itself is completely intact. We restored it soon after you left, rebuilding the parts that had been damaged at the start of the war. The work of manufacturing news goes on all the time in this particular building. We are very careful to see that each part fits in with all the other parts. Much time and effort are devoted to it.\""," Franks touched one of the tiny model buildings, lying half in ruins. \"So this is what you spend your time doing--making model cities and then blasting them.\""," \"No, we do much more. We are caretakers, watching over the whole world. The owners have left for a time, and we must see that the cities are kept clean, that decay is prevented, that everything is kept oiled and in running condition. The gardens, the streets, the water mains, everything must be maintained as it was eight years ago, so that when the owners return, they will not be displeased. We want to be sure that they will be completely satisfied.\""," Franks tapped Moss on the arm."," \"Come over here,\" he said in a low voice. \"I want to talk to you.\""," He led Moss and Taylor out of the building, away from the leadys, outside on the hillside. The soldiers followed them. The Sun was up and the sky was turning blue. The air smelled sweet and good, the smell of growing things."," Taylor removed his helmet and took a deep breath."," \"I haven't smelled that smell for a long time,\" he said."," \"Listen,\" Franks said, his voice low and hard. \"We must get back down at once. There's a lot to get started on. All this can be turned to our advantage.\""," \"What do you mean?\" Moss asked."," \"It's a certainty that the Soviets have been tricked, too, the same as us. But we have found out. That gives us an edge over them.\""," \"I see.\" Moss nodded. \"We know, but they don't. Their Surface Council has sold out, the same as ours. It works against them the same way. But if we could--\""," \"With a hundred top-level men, we could take over again, restore things as they should be! It would be easy!\""," *****"," Moss touched him on the arm. An A-class leady was coming from the building toward them."," \"We've seen enough,\" Franks said, raising his voice. \"All this is very serious. It must be reported below and a study made to determine our policy.\""," The leady said nothing."," Franks waved to the soldiers. \"Let's go.\" He started toward the warehouse."," Most of the soldiers had removed their helmets. Some of them had taken their lead suits off, too, and were relaxing comfortably in their cotton uniforms. They stared around them, down the hillside at the trees and bushes, the vast expanse of green, the mountains and the sky."," \"Look at the Sun,\" one of them murmured."," \"It sure is bright as hell,\" another said."," \"We're going back down,\" Franks said. \"Fall in by twos and follow us.\""," Reluctantly, the soldiers regrouped. The leadys watched without emotion as the men marched slowly back toward the warehouse. Franks and Moss and Taylor led them across the ground, glancing alertly at the leadys as they walked."," They entered the warehouse. D-class leadys were loading material and weapons on surface carts. Cranes and derricks were working busily everywhere. The work was done with efficiency, but without hurry or excitement."," The men stopped, watching. Leadys operating the little carts moved past them, signaling silently to each other. Guns and parts were being hoisted by magnetic cranes and lowered gently onto waiting carts."," \"Come on,\" Franks said."," He turned toward the lip of the Tube. A row of D-class leadys was standing in front of it, immobile and silent. Franks stopped, moving back. He looked around. An A-class leady was coming toward him."," \"Tell them to get out of the way,\" Franks said. He touched his gun. \"You had better move them.\""," Time passed, an endless moment, without measure. The men stood, nervous and alert, watching the row of leadys in front of them."," \"As you wish,\" the A-class leady said."," It signaled and the D-class leadys moved into life. They stepped slowly aside."," Moss breathed a sigh of relief."," \"I'm glad that's over,\" he said to Franks. \"Look at them all. Why don't they try to stop us? They must know what we're going to do.\""," Franks laughed. \"Stop us? You saw what happened when they tried to stop us before. They can't; they're only machines. We built them so they can't lay hands on us, and they know that.\""," His voice trailed off."," The men stared at the Tube entrance. Around them the leadys watched, silent and impassive, their metal faces expressionless."," For a long time the men stood without moving. At last Taylor turned away."," \"Good God,\" he said. He was numb, without feeling of any kind."," The Tube was gone. It was sealed shut, fused over. Only a dull surface of cooling metal greeted them."," The Tube had been closed."," *****"," Franks turned, his face pale and vacant."," The A-class leady shifted. \"As you can see, the Tube has been shut. We were prepared for this. As soon as all of you were on the surface, the order was given. If you had gone back when we asked you, you would now be safely down below. We had to work quickly because it was such an immense operation.\""," \"But why?\" Moss demanded angrily."," \"Because it is unthinkable that you should be allowed to resume the war. With all the Tubes sealed, it will be many months before forces from below can reach the surface, let alone organize a military program. By that time the cycle will have entered its last stages. You will not be so perturbed to find your world intact."," \"We had hoped that you would be undersurface when the sealing occurred. Your presence here is a nuisance. When the Soviets broke through, we were able to accomplish their sealing without--\""," \"The Soviets? They broke through?\""," \"Several months ago, they came up unexpectedly to see why the war had not been won. We were forced to act with speed. At this moment they are desperately attempting to cut new Tubes to the surface, to resume the war. We have, however, been able to seal each new one as it appears.\""," The leady regarded the three men calmly."," \"We're cut off,\" Moss said, trembling. \"We can't get back. What'll we do?\""," \"How did you manage to seal the Tube so quickly?\" Franks asked the leady. \"We've been up here only two hours.\""," \"Bombs are placed just above the first stage of each Tube for such emergencies. They are heat bombs. They fuse lead and rock.\""," Gripping the handle of his gun, Franks turned to Moss and Taylor."," \"What do you say? We can't go back, but we can do a lot of damage, the fifteen of us. We have Bender guns. How about it?\""," He looked around. The soldiers had wandered away again, back toward the exit of the building. They were standing outside, looking at the valley and the sky. A few of them were carefully climbing down the slope."," \"Would you care to turn over your suits and guns?\" the A-class leady asked politely. \"The suits are uncomfortable and you'll have no need for weapons. The Russians have given up theirs, as you can see.\""," Fingers tensed on triggers. Four men in Russian uniforms were coming toward them from an aircraft that they suddenly realized had landed silently some distance away."," \"Let them have it!\" Franks shouted."," \"They are unarmed,\" said the leady. \"We brought them here so you could begin peace talks.\""," \"We have no authority to speak for our country,\" Moss said stiffly."," \"We do not mean diplomatic discussions,\" the leady explained. \"There will be no more. The working out of daily problems of existence will teach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but it will be done.\""," *****"," The Russians halted and they faced each other with raw hostility."," \"I am Colonel Borodoy and I regret giving up our guns,\" the senior Russian said. \"You could have been the first Americans to be killed in almost eight years.\""," \"Or the first Americans to kill,\" Franks corrected."," \"No one would know of it except yourselves,\" the leady pointed out. \"It would be useless heroism. Your real concern should be surviving on the surface. We have no food for you, you know.\""," Taylor put his gun in its holster. \"They've done a neat job of neutralizing us, damn them. I propose we move into a city, start raising crops with the help of some leadys, and generally make ourselves comfortable.\" Drawing his lips tight over his teeth, he glared at the A-class leady. \"Until our families can come up from undersurface, it's going to be pretty lonesome, but we'll have to manage.\""," \"If I may make a suggestion,\" said another Russian uneasily. \"We tried living in a city. It is too empty. It is also too hard to maintain for so few people. We finally settled in the most modern village we could find.\""," \"Here in this country,\" a third Russian blurted. \"We have much to learn from you.\""," The Americans abruptly found themselves laughing."," \"You probably have a thing or two to teach us yourselves,\" said Taylor generously, \"though I can't imagine what.\""," The Russian colonel grinned. \"Would you join us in our village? It would make our work easier and give us company.\""," \"Your village?\" snapped Franks. \"It's American, isn't it? It's ours!\""," The leady stepped between them. \"When our plans are completed, the term will be interchangeable. 'Ours' will eventually mean mankind's.\" It pointed at the aircraft, which was warming up. \"The ship is waiting. Will you join each other in making a new home?\""," The Russians waited while the Americans made up their minds."," \"I see what the leadys mean about diplomacy becoming outmoded,\" Franks said at last. \"People who work together don't need diplomats. They solve their problems on the operational level instead of at a conference table.\""," The leady led them toward the ship. \"It is the goal of history, unifying the world. From family to tribe to city-state to nation to hemisphere, the direction has been toward unification. Now the hemispheres will be joined and--\""," Taylor stopped listening and glanced back at the location of the Tube. Mary was undersurface there. He hated to leave her, even though he couldn't see her again until the Tube was unsealed. But then he shrugged and followed the others."," If this tiny amalgam of former enemies was a good example, it wouldn't be too long before he and Mary and the rest of humanity would be living on the surface like rational human beings instead of blindly hating moles."," \"It has taken thousands of generations to achieve,\" the A-class leady concluded. \"Hundreds of centuries of bloodshed and destruction. But each war was a step toward uniting mankind. And now the end is in sight: a world without war. But even that is only the beginning of a new stage of history.\""," \"The conquest of space,\" breathed Colonel Borodoy."," \"The meaning of life,\" Moss added."," \"Eliminating hunger and poverty,\" said Taylor."," The leady opened the door of the ship. \"All that and more. How much more? We cannot foresee it any more than the first men who formed a tribe could foresee this day. But it will be unimaginably great.\""," The door closed and the ship took off toward their new home."],"excerpt":"No weapon has ever been frightful enough to put a stop to war--perhaps because we never before had any that thought for themselves!\n\n\n\nTaylor sat back in his chair reading the morning newspaper.

Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I'm not the first to discover it. Maybe it's even under control."," I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a paperbacked book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the reference that first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn't respond. It took some time for the full import to sink in. After I'd comprehended, it seemed odd I hadn't noticed it right away."," The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties, not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out, customarily masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise, however, became transparent in the face of the following observations by the author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew everything--and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble remembering it even now) read:"," ...his eyes slowly roved about the room."," Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through the air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the story was surprised. That's what tipped me off. No sign of amazement at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified."," ...his eyes moved from person to person."," There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from the rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they belonged to the same species."," And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author was taking it rather too easily in his stride. Evidently, he felt this was quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this knowledge. The story continued:"," ...presently his eyes fastened on Julia."," Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I sighed with relief. They weren't all non-Terrestrials. The narrative continues:"," ...slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her."," Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family regarded me in wonder."," \"What's wrong, dear?\" my wife asked."," I couldn't tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. \"Nothing,\" I gasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room."," *****"," In the garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I read the next revealing passage:"," ...he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile."," It's not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it was thrown away. I don't care. In any case, the full meaning was there, staring me right in the face."," Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their anatomy at will. Eyes, arms--and maybe more. Without batting an eyelash. My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point. Obviously they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of primitive single-celled things. Beings no more developed than starfish. Starfish can do the same thing, you know."," I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly by the author without the faintest tremor:"," ...outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went inside, part over to the cafe for dinner."," Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities. Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really stumbled onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this passage:"," ...I'm afraid there's no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has lost his head again."," Which was followed by:"," ...and Bob says he has utterly no guts."," Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person, however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:"," ...totally lacking in brains."," *****"," There was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I had thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also being an alien life form, similar to the rest:"," ...quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the young man."," It didn't relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I didn't really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in her usual manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart, arms, eyes, brains, viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion demanded.

It slid from the counter, turned over a couple of times, and fell to the floor face up."," The salesman picked it up and brushed it off. Carefully, almost tenderly, he restored it to his wallet. The waitress' eyes flickered as she caught a glimpse of it."," \"Damn nice,\" the salesman observed, with a wink. \"Wouldn't you say so?\""," The waitress shrugged indifferently. \"I don't know. I saw a lot of them around Denver. A whole colony.\""," \"That's where this was taken. Denver DCA Camp.\""," \"Any still alive?\" the farmer asked."," The salesman laughed harshly. \"You kidding?\" He made a short, sharp swipe with his hand. \"Not any more.\""," They were all listening. Even the high school kids in the booth had stopped holding hands and were sitting up straight, eyes wide with fascination."," \"Saw a funny kind down near San Diego,\" the farmer said. \"Last year, some time. Had wings like a bat. Skin, not feathers. Skin and bone wings.\""," The rat-eyed taxi driver chimed in. \"That's nothing. There was a two-headed one in Detroit. I saw it on exhibit.\""," \"Was it alive?\" the waitress asked."," \"No. They'd already euthed it.\""," \"In sociology,\" the high school boy spoke up, \"we saw tapes of a whole lot of them. The winged kind from down south, the big-headed one they found in Germany, an awful-looking one with sort of cones, like an insect. And --\""," \"The worst of all,\" the elderly businessman stated, \"are those English ones. That hid out in the coal mines. The ones they didn't find until last year.\" He shook his head. \"Forty years, down there in the mines, breeding and developing. Almost a hundred of them. Survivors from a group that went underground during the War.\""," \"They just found a new kind in Sweden,\" the waitress said. \"I was reading about it. Controls minds at a distance, they said. Only a couple of them. The DCA got there plenty fast.\""," \"That's a variation of the New Zealand type,\" one of the workmen said. \"It read minds.\""," \"Reading and controlling are two different things,\" the businessman said. \"When I hear something like that I'm plenty glad there's the DCA.\""," \"There was a type they found right after the War,\" the farmer said. \"In Siberia. Had the ability to control objects. Psychokinetic ability. The Soviet DCA got it right away. Nobody remembers that any more.\""," \"I remember that,\" the businessman said. \"I was just a kid, then. I remember because that was the first deeve I ever heard of. My father called me into the living room and told me and my brothers and sisters. We were still building the house. That was in the days when the DCA inspected everyone and stamped their arms.\" He held up his thin, gnarled wrist. \"I was stamped there, sixty years ago.\""," \"Now they just have the birth inspection,\" the waitress said. She shivered. \"There was one in San Francisco this month. First in over a year. They thought it was over, around here.\""," \"It's been dwindling,\" the taxi driver said. \"Frisco wasn't too bad hit. Not like some. Not like Detroit.\""," \"They still get ten or fifteen a year in Detroit,\" the high school boy said. \"All around there. Lots of pools still left. People go into them, in spite of the robot signs.\""," \"What kind was this one?\" the salesman asked. \"The one they found in San Francisco.\""," The waitress gestured. \"Common type. The kind with no toes. Bent-over. Big eyes.\""," \"The nocturnal type,\" the salesman said."," \"The mother had hid it. They say it was three years old. She got the doctor to forge the DCA chit. Old friend of the family.\""," The salesman had finished his coke. He sat playing idly with his cigarettes, listening to the hum of talk he had set into motion. The high school boy was leaning excitedly toward the girl across from him, impressing her with his fund of knowledge. The lean farmer and the businessman were huddled together, remembering the old days, the last years of the War, before the first Ten-Year Reconstruction Plan. The taxi driver and the two workmen were swapping yarns about their own experiences."," The salesman caught the waitress's attention. \"I guess,\" he said thoughtfully, \"that one in Frisco caused quite a stir. Something like that happening so close.\""," \"Yeah,\" the waitress murmured."," \"This side of the Bay wasn't really hit,\" the salesman continued. \"You never get any of them over here.\""," \"No.\" The waitress moved abruptly. \"None in this area. Ever.\" She scooped up dirty dishes from the counter and headed toward the back."," \"Never?\" the salesman asked, surprised. \"You've never had any deeves on this side of the Bay?\""," \"No. None.\" She disappeared into the back, where the fry cook stood by his burners, white apron and tattooed wrists. Her voice was a little too loud, a little too harsh and strained. It made the farmer pause suddenly and glance up."," Silence dropped like a curtain. All sound cut off instantly. They were all gazing down at their food, suddenly tense and ominous."," \"None around here,\" the taxi driver said, loudly and clearly, to no one in particular. \"None ever.\""," \"Sure,\" the salesman agreed genially. \"I was only --\""," \"Make sure you get that straight,\" one of the workmen said."," The salesman blinked. \"Sure, buddy. Sure.\" He fumbled nervously in his pocket. A quarter and a dime jangled to the floor and he hurriedly scooped them up. \"No offense.\""," For a moment there was silence. Then the high school boy spoke up, aware for the first time that nobody was saying anything. \"I heard something,\" he began eagerly, voice full of importance. \"Somebody said they saw something up by the Johnson farm that looked like it was one of those --\""," \"Shut up,\" the businessman said, without turning his head."," Scarlet-faced, the boy sagged in his seat. His voice wavered and broke off. He peered hastily down at his hands and swallowed unhappily."," The salesman paid the waitress for his coke. \"What's the quickest road to Frisco?\" he began. But the waitress had already turned her back."," The people at the counter were immersed in their food. None of them looked up. They ate in frozen silence. Hostile, unfriendly faces, intent on their food."," The salesman picked up his bulging briefcase, pushed open the screen door, and stepped out into the blazing sunlight. He moved toward his battered 1978 Buick, parked a few meters up. A blue-shirted traffic cop was standing in the shade of an awning, talking languidly to a young woman in a yellow silk dress that clung moistly to her slim body."," The salesman paused a moment before he got into his car. He waved his hand and hailed the policeman. \"Say, you know this town pretty good?\""," The policeman eyed the salesman's rumpled gray suit, bowtie, his sweat-stained shirt. The out-of-state license. \"What do you want?\""," \"I'm looking for the Johnson farm,\" the salesman said. \"Here to see him about some litigation.\" He moved toward the policeman, a small white card between his fingers. \"I'm his attorney -- from the New York Guild. Can you tell me how to get out there? I haven't been through here in a couple of years.\"","",""," Nat Johnson gazed up at the noonday sun and saw that it was good. He sat sprawled out on the bottom step of the porch, a pipe between his yellowed teeth, a lithe, wiry man in red-checkered shirt and canvas jeans, powerful hands, iron-gray hair that was still thick despite sixty-five years of active life."," He was watching the children play. Jean rushed laughing in front of him, bosom heaving under her sweatshirt, black hair streaming behind her. She was sixteen, bright-eyed, legs strong and straight, slim young body bent slightly forward with the weight of the two horseshoes. After her scampered Dave, fourteen, white teeth and black hair, a handsome boy, a son to be proud of. Dave caught up with his sister, passed her, and reached the far peg. He stood waiting, legs apart, hands on his hips, his two horseshoes gripped easily. Gasping, Jean hurried toward him."," \"Go ahead!\" Dave shouted. \"You shoot first. I'm waiting for you.\""," \"So you can knock them away?\""," \"So I can knock them closer.\""," Jean tossed down one horseshoe and gripped the other with both hands, eyes on the distant peg. Her lithe body bent, one leg slid back, her spine arched. She took careful aim, closed one eye, and then expertly tossed the shoe. With a clang the shoe struck the distant peg, circled briefly around it, then bounced off again and rolled to one side. A cloud of dust rolled up."," \"Not bad,\" Nat Johnson admitted, from his step. \"Too hard, though. Take it easy.\" His chest swelled with pride as the girl's glistening body took aim and again threw. Two powerful, handsome children, almost ripe, on the verge of adulthood. Playing together in the hot sun."," And there was Cris."," Cris stood by the porch, arms folded. He wasn't playing. He was watching. He had stood there since Dave and Jean had begun playing, the same half-intent, half-remote expression on his finely-cut face. As if he were seeing past them, beyond the two of them. Beyond the field, the barn, the creek bed, the rows of cedars."," \"Come on, Cris!\" Jean called, as she and Dave moved across the field to collect their horseshoes. \"Don't you want to play?\""," No, Cris didn't want to play. He never played. He was off in a world of his own, a world into which none of them could come. He never joined in anything, games or chores or family activities. He was by himself always. Remote, detached, aloof. Seeing past everyone and everything -- that is, until all at once something clicked and he momentarily rephased, reentered their world briefly."," Nat Johnson reached out and knocked his pipe against the step. He refilled it from his leather tobacco pouch, his eyes on his eldest son. Cris was now moving into life. Heading out onto the field. He walked slowly, arms folded calmly, as if he had, for the moment, descended from his own world into theirs. Jean didn't see him; she had turned her back and was getting ready to pitch."," \"Hey,\" Dave said, startled. \"Here's Cris.\""," Cris reached his sister, stopped, and held out his hand. A great dignified figure, calm and impassive. Uncertainly, Jean gave him one of the horseshoes. \"You want this? You want to play?\""," Cris said nothing. He bent slightly, a supple arc of his incredibly graceful body, then moved his arm in a blur of speed. The shoe sailed, struck the far peg, and dizzily spun around it. Ringer."," The corners of Dave's mouth turned down. \"What a lousy darn thing.\""," \"Cris,\" Jean reproved. \"You don't play fair.\""," No, Cris didn't play fair. He had watched half an hour -- then come out and thrown once. One perfect toss, one dead ringer."," \"He never makes a mistake,\" Dave complained."," Cris stood, face blank. A golden statue in the mid-day sun. Golden hair, skin, a light down of gold fuzz on his bare arms and legs --"," Abruptly he stiffened. Nat sat up, startled. \"What is it?\" he barked."," Cris turned in a quick circle, magnificent body alert. \"Cris!\" Jean demanded. \"What --\""," Cris shot forward. Like a released energy beam he bounded across the field, over the fence, into the barn and out the other side. His flying figure seemed to skim over the dry grass as he descended into the barren creek bed, between the cedars. A momentary flash of gold -- and he was gone. Vanished. There was no sound. No motion. He had utterly melted into the scenery."," \"What was it this time?\" Jean asked wearily. She came over to her father and threw herself down in the shade. Sweat glowed on her smooth neck and upper lip; her sweat shirt was streaked and damp. \"What did he see?\""," \"He was after something,\" Dave stated, coming up."," Nat grunted. \"Maybe. There's no telling.\""," \"I guess I better tell Mom not to set a place for him,\" Jean said. \"He probably won't be back.\""," Anger and futility descended over Nat Johnson. No, he wouldn't be back. Not for dinner and probably not the next day -- or the one after that. He'd be gone God only knew how long. Or where. Or why. Off by himself, alone some place. \"If I thought there was any use,\" Nat began, \"I'd send you two after him. But there's no --\""," He broke off. A car was coming up the dirt road toward the farmhouse. A dusty, battered old Buick. Behind the wheel sat a plump red-faced man in a gray suit, who waved cheerfully at them as the car sputtered to a stop and the motor died into silence."," \"Afternoon,\" the man nodded, as he climbed out the car. He tipped his hat pleasantly. He was middle-aged, genial-looking, perspiring freely as he crossed the dry ground toward the porch. \"Maybe you folks can help me.\""," \"What do you want?\" Nat Johnson demanded hoarsely. He was frightened. He watched the creek bed out of the corner of his eye, praying silently. God, if only he stayed away. Jean was breathing quickly, sharp little gasps. She was terrified. Dave's face was expressionless, but all color had drained from it. \"Who are you?\" Nat demanded."," \"Name's Baines. George Baines.\" The man held out his hand but Johnson ignored it. \"Maybe you've heard of me. I own the Pacifica Development Corporation. We built all those little bomb-proof houses just outside town. Those little round ones you see as you come up the main highway from Lafayette.\""," \"What do you want?\" Johnson held his hands steady with an effort. He'd never heard of the man, although he'd noticed the housing tract. It couldn't be missed -- a great ant-heap of ugly pill-boxes straddling the highway. Baines looked like the kind of man who'd own them. But what did he want here?"," \"I've bought some land up this way,\" Baines was explaining. He rattled a sheaf of crisp papers. \"This is the deed, but I'll be damned if I can find it.\" He grinned good-naturedly. \"I know it's around this way, someplace, this side of the State road. According to the clerk at the County Recorder's Office, a mile or so this side of that hill over there. But I'm no damn good at reading maps.\""," \"It isn't around here,\" Dave broke in. \"There's only farms around here. Nothing for sale.\""," \"This is a farm, son,\" Baines said genially. \"I bought it for myself and my missus. So we could settle down.\" He wrinkled his pug nose. \"Don't get the wrong idea -- I'm not putting up any tracts around here. This is strictly for myself. An old farmhouse, twenty acres, a pump and a few oak trees --\""," \"Let me see the deed.\" Johnson grabbed the sheaf of papers, and while Baines blinked in astonishment, he leafed rapidly through them. His face hardened and he handed them back. \"What are you up to? This deed is for a parcel fifty miles from here.\""," \"Fifty miles!\" Baines was dumbfounded. \"No kidding? But the clerk told me --\""," Johnson was on his feet. He towered over the fat man. He was in top-notch physical shape -- and he was plenty damn suspicious. \"Clerk, hell. You get back into your car and drive out of here. I don't know what you're after, or what you're here for, but I want you off my land.\""," In Johnson's massive fist something sparkled. A metal tube that gleamed ominously in the mid-day sunlight. Baines saw it -- and gulped. \"No offense, mister.\" He backed nervously away. \"You folks sure are touchy. Take it easy, will you?\""," Johnson said nothing. He gripped the lash-tube tighter and waited for the fat man to leave."," But Baines lingered. \"Look, buddy. I've been driving around this furnace five hours, looking for my damn place. Any objection to my using your facilities?\""," Johnson eyed him with suspicion. Gradually the suspicion turned to disgust. He shrugged. \"Dave, show him where the bathroom is.\""," \"Thanks.\" Baines grinned thankfully. \"And if it wouldn't be too much trouble, maybe a glass of water. I'd be glad to pay you for it.\" He chuckled knowingly. \"Never let the city people get away with anything, eh?\""," \"Christ.\" Johnson turned away in revulsion as the fat man lumbered after his son, into the house."," \"Dad,\" Jean whispered. As soon as Baines was inside she hurried up onto the porch, eyes wide with fear. \"Dad, do you think he --\""," Johnson put his arm around her. \"Just hold on tight. He'll be gone, soon.\""," The girl's dark eyes flashed with mute terror. \"Every time the man from the water company, or the tax collector, some tramp, children, anybody come around, I get a terrible stab of pain -- here.\" She clutched at her heart, hand against her breasts. \"It's been that way thirteen years. How much longer can we keep it going? How long?\"","",""," The man named Baines emerged gratefully from the bathroom. Dave Johnson stood silently by the door, body rigid, youthful face stony."," \"Thanks, son,\" Baines sighed. \"Now where can I get a glass of cold water?\" He smacked his thick lips in anticipation. \"After you've been driving around the sticks looking for a dump some red-hot real estate agent stuck you with --\""," Dave headed into the kitchen. \"Mom, this man wants a drink of water. Dad said he could have it.\""," Dave had turned his back. Baines caught a brief glimpse of the mother, gray-haired, small, moving toward the sink with a glass, face withered and drawn, without expression."," Then Baines hurried from the room down a hall. He passed through a bedroom, pulled a door open, found himself facing a closet. He turned and raced back, through the living room, into a dining room, then another bedroom. In a brief instant he had gone through the whole house."," He peered out a window. The back yard. Remains of a rusting truck. Entrance of an underground bomb shelter. Tin cans. Chickens scratching around. A dog, asleep under a shed. A couple of old auto tires."," He found a door leading out. Soundlessly, he tore the door open and stepped outside. No one was in sight. There was the barn, a leaning, ancient wood structure. Cedar trees beyond, a creek of some kind. What had once been an outhouse."," Baines moved cautiously around the side of the house. He had perhaps thirty seconds. He had left the door of the bathroom closed; the boy would think he had gone back in there. Baines looked into the house through a window. A large closet, filled with old clothing, boxes and bundles of magazines."," He turned and started back. He reached the corner of the house and started around it."," Nat Johnson's gaunt shape loomed up and blocked his way. \"All right, Baines. You asked for it.\""," A pink flash blossomed. It shut out the sunlight in a single blinding burst. Baines leaped back and clawed at his coat pocket. The edge of the flash caught him and he half-fell, stunned by the force. His suit-shield sucked in the energy and discharged it, but the power rattled his teeth and for a moment he jerked like a puppet on a string. Darkness ebbed around him. He could feel the mesh of the shield glow white, as it absorbed the energy and fought to control it."," His own tube came out -- and Johnson had no shield. \"You're under arrest,\" Baines muttered grimly. \"Put down your tube and your hands up. And call your family.\" He made a motion with the tube. \"Come on, Johnson. Make it snappy.\""," The lash-tube wavered and then slipped from Johnson's fingers. \"You're still alive.\" Dawning horror crept across his face. \"Then you must be --\""," Dave and Jean appeared. \"Dad!\""," \"Come over here,\" Baines ordered. \"Where's your mother?\""," Dave jerked his head numbly. \"Inside.\""," \"Get her and bring her here.\""," \"You're DCA,\" Nat Johnson whispered."," Baines didn't answer. He was doing something with his neck, pulling at the flabby flesh. The wiring of a contact mike glittered as he slipped it from a fold between two chins and into his pocket. From the dirt road came the sound of motors, sleek purrs that rapidly grew louder. Two teardrops of black metal came gliding up and parked beside the house. Men swarmed out, in the dark gray-green of the Government Civil Police. In the sky swarms of black dots were descending, clouds of ugly flies that darkened the sun as they spilled out men and equipment. The men drifted slowly down."," \"He's not here,\" Baines said, as the first man reached him. \"He got away. Inform Wisdom back at the lab.\""," \"We've got this section blocked off.\""," Baines turned to Nat Johnson, who stood in dazed silence, uncomprehending, his son and daughter beside him. \"How did he know we were coming?\" Baines demanded."," \"I don't know,\" Johnson muttered. \"He just -- knew.\""," \"A telepath?\""," \"I don't know.\""," Baines shrugged. \"We'll know, soon. A clamp is out, all around here. He can't get past, no matter what the hell he can do. Unless he can dematerialize himself.\""," \"What'll you do with him when you -- if you catch him?\" Jean asked huskily."," \"Study him.\""," \"And then kill him?\""," \"That depends on the lab evaluation. If you could give me more to work on, I could predict better.\""," \"We can't tell you anything. We don't know anything more.\" The girl's voice rose with desperation. \"He doesn't talk.\""," Baines jumped. \"What?\""," \"He doesn't talk. He never talked to us. Ever.\""," \"How old is he?\""," \"Eighteen.\""," \"No communication.\" Baines was sweating. \"In eighteen years there hasn't been any semantic bridge between you? Does he have any contact? Signs? Codes?\""," \"He -- ignores us. He eats here, stays with us. Sometimes he plays when we play. Or sits with us. He's gone days on end. We've never been able to find out what he's doing -- or where. He sleeps in the barn -- by himself.\""," \"Is he really gold-colored?\""," \"Yes. Skin, eyes, hair, nails. Everything.\""," \"And he's large? Well-formed?\""," It was a moment before the girl answered. A strange emotion stirred her drawn features, a momentary glow. \"He's incredibly beautiful. A god come down to earth.\" Her lips twisted. \"You won't find him. He can do things. Things you have no comprehension of. Powers so far beyond your limited --\""," \"You don't think we'll get him?\" Baines frowned. \"More teams are landing all the time. You've never seen an Agency clamp in operation. We've had sixty years to work out all the bugs. If he gets away it'll be the first time --\""," Baines broke off abruptly. Three men were quickly approaching the porch. Two green-clad Civil Police. And a third man between them. A man who moved silently, lithely, a faintly luminous shape that towered above them."," \"Cris!\" Jean screamed."," \"We got him,\" one of the police said."," Baines fingered his lash-tube uneasily. \"Where? How?\""," \"He gave himself up,\" the policeman answered, voice full of awe. \"He came to us voluntarily. Look at him. He's like a metal statue. Like some sort of -- god.\""," The golden figure halted for a moment beside Jean. Then it turned slowly, calmly, to face Baines."," \"Cris!\" Jean shrieked. \"Why did you come back?\""," The same thought was eating at Baines, too. He shoved it aside -- for the time being. \"Is the jet out front?\" he demanded quickly."," \"Ready to go,\" one of the CP answered."," \"Fine.\" Baines strode past them, down the steps and onto the dirt field. \"Let's go. I want him taken directly to the lab.\" For a moment he studied the massive figure who stood calmly between the two Civil Policemen. Beside him, they seemed to have shrunk, become ungainly and repellent. Like dwarves... What had Jean said? A god come to earth. Baines broke angrily away. \"Come on,\" he muttered brusquely. \"This one may be tough; we've never run up against one like it before. We don't know what the hell it can do.\"","",""," The chamber was empty, except for the seated figure. Four bare walls, floor and ceiling. A steady glare of white light relentlessly etched every corner of the chamber. Near the top of the far wall ran a narrow slot, the view windows through which the interior of the chamber was scanned."," The seated figure was quiet. He hadn't moved since the chamber locks had slid into place, since the heavy bolts had fallen from outside and the rows of bright-faced technicians had taken their places at the view windows. He gazed down at the floor, bent forward, hands clasped together, face calm, almost expressionless. In four hours he hadn't moved a muscle."," \"Well?\" Baines said. \"What have you learned?\""," Wisdom grunted sourly. \"Not much. If we don't have him doped out in forty-eight hours we'll go ahead with the euth. We can't take any chances.\""," \"You're thinking about the Tunis type,\" Baines said. He was, too. They had found ten of them, living in the ruins of the abandoned North African town. Their survival method was simple. They killed and absorbed other life forms, then imitated them and took their places. Chameleons, they were called. It had cost sixty lives, before the last one was destroyed. Sixty top-level experts, highly trained DCA men."," \"Any clues?\" Baines asked."," \"He's different as hell. This is going to be tough.\" Wisdom thumbed a pile of tape-spools. \"This is the complete report, all the material we got from Johnson and his family. We pumped them with the psych-wash, then let them go home. Eighteen years -- and no semantic bridge. Yet, he looks fully developed. Mature at thirteen -- a shorter, faster life-cycle than ours. But why the mane? All the gold fuzz? Like a Roman monument that's been gilded.\""," \"Has the report come in from the analysis room? You had a wave-shot taken, of course.\""," \"His brain pattern has been fully scanned. But it takes time for them to plot it out. We're all running around like lunatics while he just sits there!\" Wisdom poked a stubby finger at the window. \"We caught him easily enough. He can't have much, can he? But I'd like to know what it is. Before we euth him.\""," \"Maybe we should keep him alive until we know.\""," \"Euth in forty-eight hours,\" Wisdom repeated stubbornly. \"Whether we know or not. I don't like him. He gives me the creeps.\""," Wisdom stood chewing nervously on his cigar, a red-haired, beefy-faced man, thick and heavy-set, with a barrel chest and cold, shrewd eyes deep-set in his hard face. Ed Wisdom was Director of DCA's North American Branch. But right now he was worried. His tiny eyes darted back and forth, alarmed flickers of gray in his brutal, massive face."," \"You think,\" Baines said slowly, \"this is it?\""," \"I always think so,\" Wisdom snapped. \"I have to think so.\""," \"I mean --\""," \"I know what you mean.\" Wisdom paced back and forth, among the study tables, technicians at their benches, equipment and humming computers. Buzzing tape-slots and research hook-ups. \"This thing lived eighteen years with his family and they don't understand it. They don't know what it has. They know what it does, but not how.\""," \"What does it do?\""," \"It knows things.\""," \"What kind of things?\""," Wisdom grabbed his lash-tube from his belt and tossed it on a table. \"Here.\""," \"What?\""," \"Here.\" Wisdom signaled, and a view window was slid back an inch. \"Shoot him.\""," Baines blinked. \"You said forty-eight hours.\""," With a curse, Wisdom snatched up the tube, aimed it through the window directly at the seated figure's back, and squeezed the trigger."," A blinding flash of pink. A cloud of energy blossomed in the center of the chamber. It sparkled, then died into dark ash."," \"Good God!\" Baines gasped. \"You --\""," He broke off. The figure was no longer sitting. As Wisdom fired, it had moved in a blur of speed, away from the blast, to the corner of the chamber. Now it was slowly coming back, face blank, still absorbed in thought."," \"Fifth time,\" Wisdom said, as he put his tube away. \"Last time Jamison and I fired together. Missed. He knew exactly when the bolts would hit. And where.\""," Baines and Wisdom looked at each other. Both of them were thinking the same thing. \"But even reading minds wouldn't tell him where they were going to hit,\" Baines said. \"When, maybe. But not where. Could you have called your own shots?\""," \"Not mine,\" Wisdom answered flatly. \"I fired fast, damn near at random.\" He frowned. \"Random. We'll have to make a test of this.\" He waved a group of technicians over. \"Get a construction team up here. On the double.\" He grabbed paper and pen and began sketching.","",""," While construction was going on, Baines met his fiancee in the lobby outside the lab, the great central lounge of the DCA Building."," \"How's it coming?\" she asked. Anita Ferris was tall and blonde, blue eyes and a mature, carefully cultivated figure. An attractive, competent-looking woman in her late twenties. She wore a metal foil dress and cape with a red and black stripe on the sleeve, the emblem of the A-Class. Anita was Director of the Semantics Agency, a top-level Government Coordinator. \"Anything of interest, this time?\""," \"Plenty.\" Baines guided her from the lobby, into the dim recess of the bar. Music played softly in the background, a shifting variety of patterns formed mathematically. Dim shapes moved expertly through the gloom, from table to table. Silent, efficient robot waiters."," As Anita sipped her Tom Collins, Baines outlined what they had found."," \"What are the chances,\" Anita asked slowly, \"that he's built up some kind of deflection-cone? There was one kind that warped their environment by direct mental effort. No tools. Direct mind to matter.\""," \"Psychokinetics?\" Baines drummed restlessly on the table top. \"I doubt it. The thing has ability to predict, not to control. He can't stop the beams, but he can sure as hell get out of the way.\""," \"Does he jump between the molecules?\""," Baines wasn't amused. \"This is serious. We've handled these things sixty years -- longer than you and I have been around added together. Eighty-seven types of deviants have shown up, real mutants that could reproduce themselves, not mere freaks. This is the eighty-eighth. We've been able to handle each of them in turn. But this --\""," \"Why are you so worried about this one?\""," \"First, it's eighteen years old. That in itself is incredible. Its family managed to hide it that long.\""," \"Those women around Denver were older than that. Those ones with --\""," \"They were in a Government camp. Somebody high up was toying with the idea of allowing them to breed. Some sort of industrial use. We withheld euth for years. But Cris Johnson stayed alive outside our control. Those things at Denver were under constant scrutiny.\""," \"Maybe he's harmless. You always assume a deeve is a menace. He might even be beneficial. Somebody thought those women might work in. Maybe this thing has something that would advance the race.\""," \"Which race? Not the human race. It's the old 'the operation was a success but the patient died' routine. If we introduce a mutant to keep us going it'll be mutants, not us, who'll inherit the earth. It'll be mutants surviving for their own sake. Don't think for a moment we can put padlocks on them and expect them to serve us. If they're really superior to homo sapiens, they'll win out in even competition. To survive, we've got to cold-deck them right from the start.\""," \"In other words, we'll know homo superior when he comes -- by definition. He'll be the one we won't be able to euth.\""," \"That's about it,\" Baines answered. \"Assuming there is a homo superior. Maybe there's just homo peculiar. Homo with an improved line.\""," \"The Neanderthal probably thought the Cro-Magnon man had merely an improved line. A little more advanced ability to conjure up symbols and shape flint. From your description, this thing is more radical than a mere improvement.\""," \"This thing,\" Baines said slowly, \"has an ability to predict. So far, it's been able to stay alive. It's been able to cope with situations better than you or I could. How long do you think we'd stay alive in that chamber, with energy beams blazing down at us? In a sense it's got the ultimate survival ability. If it can always be accurate --\""," A wall-speaker sounded. \"Baines, you're wanted in the lab. Get the hell out of the bar and upramp.\""," Baines pushed back his chair and got to his feet. \"Come along. You may be interested in seeing what Wisdom has got dreamed up.\"","",""," A tight group of top-level DCA officials stood around in a circle, middle-aged, gray-haired, listening to a skinny youth in a white shirt and rolled-up sleeves explaining an elaborate cube of metal and plastic that filled the center of the view-platform. From it jutted an ugly array of tube snouts, gleaming muzzles that disappeared into an intricate maze of wiring."," \"This,\" the youth was saying briskly, \"is the first real test. It fires at random -- as nearly random as we can make it, at least. Weighted balls are thrown up in an air stream, then dropped free to fall back and cut relays. They can fall in almost any pattern. The thing fires according to their pattern. Each drop produces a new configuration of timing and position. Ten tubes, in all. Each will be in constant motion.\""," \"And nobody knows how they'll fire?\" Anita asked."," \"Nobody.\" Wisdom rubbed his thick hands together. \"Mind reading won't help him, not with this thing.\""," Anita moved over to the view windows, as the cube was rolled into place. She gasped. \"Is that him?\""," \"What's wrong?\" Baines asked."," Anita's cheeks were flushed. \"Why, I expected a -- a thing. My God, he's beautiful! Like a golden statue. Like a deity!\""," Baines laughed. \"He's eighteen years old, Anita. Too young for you.\""," The woman was still peering through the view window. \"Look at him. Eighteen? I don't believe it.\""," Cris Johnson sat in the center of the chamber, on the floor. A posture of contemplation, head bowed, arms folded, legs tucked under him. In the stark glare of the overhead lights his powerful body glowed and rippled, a shimmering figure of downy gold."," \"Pretty, isn't he?\" Wisdom muttered. \"All right. Start it going.\""," \"You're going to kill him?\" Anita demanded."," \"We're going to try.\""," \"But he's --\" She broke off uncertainly. \"He's not a monster. He's not like those others, those hideous things with two heads, or those insects. Or those awful things from Tunis.\""," \"What is he, then?\" Baines asked."," \"I don't know. But you can't just kill him. It's terrible!\""," The cube clicked into life. The muzzles jerked, silently altered position. Three retracted, disappeared into the body of the cube. Others came out. Quickly, efficiently, they moved into position -- and abruptly, without warning, opened fire."," A staggering burst of energy fanned out, a complex pattern that altered each moment, different angles, different velocities, a bewildering blur that cracked from the windows down into the chamber."," The golden figure moved. He dodged back and forth, expertly avoiding the bursts of energy that seared around him on all sides. Rolling clouds of ash obscured him; he was lost in a mist of crackling fire and ash."," \"Stop it!\" Anita shouted. \"For God's sake, you'll destroy him!\""," The chamber was an inferno of energy. The figure had completely disappeared. Wisdom waited a moment, then nodded to the technicians operating the cube. They touched guide buttons and the muzzles slowed and died. Some sank back into the cube. All became silent. The works of the cube ceased humming."," Cris Johnson was still alive. He emerged from the settling clouds of ash, blackened and singed. But unhurt. He had avoided each beam. He had weaved between them and among them as they came, a dancer leaping over glittering sword-points of pink fire. He had survived."," \"No,\" Wisdom murmured, shaken and grim. \"Not a telepath. Those were at random. No prearranged pattern.\""," The three of them looked at each other, dazed and frightened. Anita was trembling. Her face was pale and her blue eyes were wide. \"What, then?\" She whispered. \"What is it? What does he have?\""," \"He's a good guesser,\" Wisdom suggested."," \"He's not guessing,\" Baines answered. \"Don't kid yourself. That's the whole point.\""," \"No, he's not guessing.\" Wisdom nodded slowly. \"He knew. He predicted each strike. I wonder... Can he err? Can he make a mistake?\""," \"We caught him,\" Baines pointed out."," \"You said he came back voluntarily.\" There was a strange look on Wisdom's face. \"Did he come back after the clamp was up?\""," Baines jumped. \"Yes, after.\""," \"He couldn't have got through the clamp. So he came back.\" Wisdom grinned wryly. \"The clamp must actually have been perfect. It was supposed to be.\""," \"If there had been a single hole,\" Baines murmured, \"he would have known it -- gone through.\""," Wisdom ordered a group of armed guards over. \"Get him out of there. To the euth stage.\""," Anita shrieked. \"Wisdom, you can't --\""," \"He's too far ahead of us. We can't compete with him.\" Wisdom's eyes were bleak. \"We can only guess what's going to happen. He knows. For him, it's a sure thing. I don't think it'll help him at euth, though. The whole stage is flooded simultaneously. Instantaneous gas, released throughout.\" He signalled impatiently to the guards. \"Get going. Take him down right away. Don't waste any time.\""," \"Can we?\" Baines murmured thoughtfully."," The guards took up positions by one of the chamber locks. Cautiously, the tower control slid the lock back. The first two guards stepped cautiously in, lash-tubes ready."," Cris stood in the center of the chamber. His back was to them as they crept toward him. For a moment he was silent, utterly unmoving. The guards fanned out, as more of them entered the chamber. Then --"," Anita screamed. Wisdom cursed. The golden figure spun and leaped forward, in a flashing blur of speed. Past the triple line of guards, through the lock and into the corridor."," \"Get him!\" Baines shouted."," Guards milled everywhere. Flashes of energy lit up the corridor, as the figure raced among them up the ramp."," \"No use,\" Wisdom said calmly. \"We can't hit him.\" He touched a button, then another. \"But maybe this will help.\""," \"What --\" Baines began. But the leaping figure shot abruptly at him, straight at him, and he dropped to one side. The figure flashed past. It ran effortlessly, face without expression, dodging and jumping as the energy beams seared around it."," For an instant the golden face loomed up before Baines. It passed and disappeared down a side corridor. Guards rushed after it, kneeling and firing, shouting orders excitedly. In the bowels of the building, heavy guns were rumbling up. Locks slid into place as escape corridors were systematically sealed off."," \"Good God,\" Baines gasped, as he got to his feet. \"Can't he do anything but run?\""," \"I gave orders,\" Wisdom said, \"to have the building isolated. There's no way out. Nobody comes and nobody goes. He's loose here in the building -- but he won't get out.\""," \"If there's one exit overlooked, he'll know it,\" Anita pointed out shakily."," \"We won't overlook any exit. We got him once; we'll get him again.\""," A messenger robot had come in. Now it presented its message respectfully to Wisdom. \"From analysis, sir.\""," Wisdom tore the tape open. \"Now we'll know how it thinks.\" His hands were shaking. \"Maybe we can figure out its blind spot. It may be able to out-think us, but that doesn't mean it's invulnerable. It only predicts the future -- it can't change it. If there's only death ahead, its ability won't...\""," Wisdom's voice faded into silence. After a moment he passed the tape to Baines."," \"I'll be down in the bar,\" Wisdom said. \"Getting a good stiff drink.\" His face had turned lead-gray. \"All I can say is I hope to hell this isn't the race to come.\""," \"What's the analysis?\" Anita demanded impatiently, peering over Baines' shoulder. \"How does it think?\""," \"It doesn't,\" Baines said, as he handed the tape back to his boss. \"It doesn't think at all. Virtually no frontal lobe. It's not a human being -- it doesn't use symbols. It's nothing but an animal.\""," \"An animal,\" Wisdom said. \"With a single highly-developed faculty. Not a superior man. Not a man at all.\"","",""," Up and down the corridors of the DCA Building, guards and equipment clanged. Loads of Civil Police were pouring into the building and taking up positions beside the guards. One by one, the corridors and rooms were being inspected and sealed off. Sooner or later the golden figure of Cris Johnson would be located and cornered."," \"We were always afraid a mutant with superior intellectual powers would come along,\" Baines said reflectively. \"A deeve who would be to us what we are to the great apes. Something with a bulging cranium, telepathic ability, a perfect semantic system, ultimate powers of symbolization and calculation. A development along our own path. A better human being.\""," \"He acts by reflex,\" Anita said wonderingly. She had the analysis and was sitting at one of the desks studying it intently. \"Reflex -- like a lion. A golden lion.\" She pushed the tape aside, a strange expression on her face. \"The lion god.\""," \"Beast,\" Wisdom corrected tartly. \"Blond beast, you mean.\""," \"He runs fast,\" Baines said, \"and that's all. No tools. He doesn't build anything or utilize anything outside himself. He just stands and waits for the right opportunity and then he runs like hell.\""," \"This is worse than anything we've anticipated,\" Wisdom said. His beefy face was lead-gray. He sagged like an old man, his blunt hands trembling and uncertain. \"To be replaced by an animal! Something that runs and hides. Something without a language!\" He spat savagely. \"That's why they weren't able to communicate with it. We wondered what kind of semantic system it had. It hasn't got any! No more ability to talk and think than a -- dog.\""," \"That means intelligence has failed,\" Baines went on huskily. \"We're the last of our line -- like the dinosaur. We've carried intelligence as far as it'll go. Too far, maybe. We've already got to the point where we know so much -- think so much -- we can't act.\""," \"Men of thought,\" Anita said. \"Not men of action. It's begun to have a paralyzing effect. But this thing --\""," \"This thing's faculty works better than ours ever did. We can recall past experiences, keep them in mind, learn from them. At best, we can make shrewd guesses about the future, from our memory of what's happened in the past. But we can't be certain. We have to speak of probabilities. Grays. Not blacks and whites. We're only guessing.\""," \"Cris Johnson isn't guessing,\" Anita added."," \"He can look ahead. See what's coming. He can -- prethink. Let's call it that. He can see into the future. Probably he doesn't perceive it as the future.\""," \"No,\" Anita said thoughtfully. \"It would seem like the present. He has a broader present. But his present lies ahead, not back. Our present is related to the past. Only the past is certain, to us. To him, the future is certain. And he probably doesn't remember the past, any more than any animal remembers what happened.\""," \"As he develops,\" Baines said, \"as his race evolves, it'll probably expand its ability to prethink. Instead of ten minutes, thirty minutes. Then an hour. A day. A year. Eventually they'll be able to keep ahead a whole lifetime. Each one of them will live in a solid, unchanging world. There'll be no variables, no uncertainty. No motion! They won't have anything to fear. Their world will be perfectly static, a solid block of matter.\""," \"And when death comes,\" Anita said, \"they'll accept it. There won't be any struggle; to them, it'll already have happened.\""," \"Already have happened,\" Baines repeated. \"To Cris, our shots had already been fired.\" He laughed harshly. \"Superior survival doesn't mean superior man. If there were another world-wide flood, only fish would survive. If there were another ice age, maybe nothing but polar bears would be left. When we opened the lock, he had already seen the men, seen exactly where they were standing and what they'd do. A neat faculty -- but not a development of mind. A pure physical sense.\""," \"But if every exit is covered,\" Wisdom repeated, \"he'll see he can't get out. He gave himself up before -- he'll give himself up again.\" He shook his head. \"An animal. Without language. Without tools.\""," \"With his new sense,\" Baines said, \"he doesn't need anything else.\" He examined his watch. \"It's after two. Is the building completely sealed off?\""," \"You can't leave,\" Wisdom stated. \"You'll have to stay here all night -- or until we catch the bastard.\""," \"I meant her.\" Baines indicated Anita. \"She's supposed to be back at Semantics by seven in the morning.\""," Wisdom shrugged. \"I have no control over her. If she wants, she can check out.\""," \"I'll stay,\" Anita decided. \"I want to be here when he -- when he's destroyed. I'll sleep here.\" She hesitated. \"Wisdom, isn't there some other way? If he's just an animal couldn't we --\""," \"A zoo?\" Wisdom's voice rose in a frenzy of hysteria. \"Keep it penned up in the zoo? Christ no! It's got to be killed!\"","",""," For a long time the great gleaming shape crouched in the darkness. He was in a store room. Boxes and cartons stretched out on all sides, heaped up in orderly rows, all neatly counted and marked. Silent and deserted."," But in a few moments people burst in and searched the room. He could see this. He saw them in all parts of the room, clear and distinct, men with lash-tubes, grim-faced, stalking with murder in their eyes."," The sight was one of many. One of a multitude of clearly-etched scenes lying tangent to his own. And to each was attached a further multitude of interlocking scenes, that finally grew hazier and dwindled away. A progressive vagueness, each syndrome less distinct."," But the immediate one, the scene that lay closest to him, was clearly visible. He could easily make out the sight of the armed men. Therefore it was necessary to be out of the room before they appeared."," The golden figure got calmly to its feet and moved to the door. The corridor was empty; he could see himself already outside, in the vacant, drumming hall of metal and recessed lights. He pushed the door boldly open and stepped out."," A lift blinked across the hall. He walked to the lift and entered it. In five minutes a group of guards would come running along and leap into the lift. By that time he would have left it and sent it back down. Now he pressed a button and rose to the next floor."," He stepped out into a deserted passage. No one was in sight. That didn't surprise him. He couldn't be surprised. The element didn't exist for him. The positions of things, the space relationships of all matter in the immediate future, were as certain for him as his own body. The only thing that was unknown was that which had already passed out of being. In a vague, dim fashion, he had occasionally wondered where things went after he had passed them."," He came to a small supply closet. It had just been searched. It would be a half an hour before anyone opened it again. He had that long; he could see that far ahead. And then --"," And then he would be able to see another area, a region farther beyond. He was always moving, advancing into new regions he had never seen before. A constantly unfolding panorama of sights and scenes, frozen landscapes spread out ahead. All objects were fixed. Pieces on a vast chess board through which he moved, arms folded, face calm. A detached observer who saw objects that lay ahead of him as clearly as those under foot."," Right now, as he crouched in the small supply closet, he saw an unusually varied multitude of scenes for the next half hour. Much lay ahead. The half hour was divided into an incredibly complex pattern of separate configurations. He had reached a critical region; he was about to move through worlds of intricate complexity."," He concentrated on a scene ten minutes away. It showed, like a three dimensional still, a heavy gun at the end of the corridor, trained all the way to the far end. Men moved cautiously from door to door, checking each room again, as they had done repeatedly. At the end of the half hour they had reached the supply closet. A scene showed them looking inside. By that time he was gone, of course. He wasn't in that scene. He had passed on to another."," The next scene showed an exit. Guards stood in a solid line. No way out. He was in that scene. Off to one side, in a niche just inside the door. The street outside was visible, stars, lights, outlines of passing cars and people."," In the next tableau he had gone back, away from the exit. There was no way out. In another tableau he saw himself at other exits, a legion of golden figures, duplicated again and again, as he explored regions ahead, one after another. But each exit was covered."," In one dim scene he saw himself lying charred and dead; he had tried to run through the line, out the exit."," But that scene was vague. One wavering, indistinct still out of many. The inflexible path along which he moved would not deviate in that direction. It would not turn him that way. The golden figure in that scene, the miniature doll in that room, was only distantly related to him. It was himself, but a far-away self. A self he would never meet. He forgot it and went on to examine the other tableau."," The myriad of tableaux that surrounded him were an elaborate maze, a web which he now considered bit by bit. He was looking down into a doll's house of infinite rooms, rooms without number, each with its furniture, its dolls, all rigid and unmoving. The same dolls and furniture were repeated in many. He, himself, appeared often. The two men on the platform. The woman. Again and again the same combinations turned up; the play was redone frequently, the same actors and props moved around in all possible ways."," Before it was time to leave the supply closet, Cris Johnson had examined each of the rooms tangent to the one he now occupied. He had consulted each, considered its contents thoroughly."," He pushed the door open and stepped calmly out into the hall. He knew exactly where he was going. And what he had to do. Crouched in the stuffy closet, he had quietly and expertly examined each miniature of himself, observed which clearly-etched configuration lay along his inflexible path, the one room of the doll house, the one set out of legions, toward which he was moving.","",""," Anita slipped out of her metal foil dress, hung it over a hanger, then unfastened her shoes and kicked them under the bed. She was just starting to unclip her bra when the door opened."," She gasped. Soundlessly, calmly, the great golden shape closed the door and bolted it after him."," Anita snatched up her lash-tube from the dressing table. Her hand shook; her whole body was trembling. \"What do you want?\" she demanded. Her fingers tightened convulsively around the tube. \"I'll kill you.\""," The figure regarded her silently, arms folded. It was the first time she had seen Cris Johnson closely. The great dignified face, handsome and impassive. Broad shoulders. The golden mane of hair, golden skin, pelt of radiant fuzz --"," \"Why?\" she demanded breathlessly. Her heart was pounding wildly. \"What do you want?\""," She could kill him easily. But the lash-tube wavered. Cris Johnson stood without fear; he wasn't at all afraid. Why not? Didn't he understand what it was? What the small metal tube could do to him?"," \"Of course,\" she said suddenly, in a choked whisper. \"You can see ahead. You know I'm not going to kill you. Or you wouldn't have come here.\""," She flushed, terrified -- and embarrassed. He knew exactly what she was going to do; he could see it as easily as she saw the walls of the room, the wall-bed with its covers folded neatly back, her clothes hanging in the closet, her purse and small things on the dressing table."," \"All right.\" Anita backed away, then abruptly put the tube down on the dressing table. \"I won't kill you. Why should I?\" She fumbled in her purse and got out her cigarettes. Shakily, she lit up, her pulse racing. She was scared. And strangely fascinated. \"Do you expect to stay here? It won't do any good. They've come through the dorm twice, already. They'll be back.\""," Could he understand her? She saw nothing on his face, only blank dignity. God, he was huge! It wasn't possible he was only eighteen, a boy, a child. He looked more like some great golden god, come down to earth."," She shook the thought off savagely. He wasn't a god. He was a beast. The blond beast, come to take the place of man. To drive man from the earth."," Anita snatched up the lash-tube. \"Get out of here! You're an animal! A big stupid animal! You can't even understand what I'm saying -- you don't even have a language. You're not human.\""," Cris Johnson remained silent. As if he were waiting. Waiting for what? He showed no sign of fear or impatience, even though the corridor outside rang with the sound of men searching, metal against metal, guns and energy tubes being dragged around, shouts and dim rumbles as section after section of the building was searched and sealed off."," \"They'll get you,\" Anita said. \"You'll be trapped here. They'll be searching this wing any moment.\" She savagely stubbed out her cigarette. \"For God's sake, what do you expect me to do?\""," Cris moved toward her. Anita shrank back. His powerful hands caught hold of her and she gasped in sudden terror. For a moment she struggled blindly, desperately."," \"Let go!\" She broke away and leaped back from him. His face was expressionless. Calmly, he came toward her, an impassive god advancing to take her. \"Get away!\" She groped for the lash-tube, trying to get up. But the tube slipped from her fingers and rolled onto the floor."," Cris bent down and picked it up. He held it out to her, in the open palm of his hand."," \"Good God,\" Anita whispered. Shakily, she accepted the tube, gripped it hesitantly, then put it down again on the dressing table."," In the half-light of the room, the great golden figure seemed to glow and shimmer, outlined against the darkness. A god -- no, not a god. An animal. A great golden beast, without a soul. She was confused. Which was he -- or was he both? She shook her head, bewildered. It was late, almost four. She was exhausted and confused."," Cris took her in his arms. Gently, kindly, he lifted her face and kissed her. His powerful hands held her tight. She couldn't breathe. Darkness, mixed with the shimmering golden haze, swept around her. Around and around it spiralled, carrying her senses away. She sank down into it gratefully. The darkness covered her and dissolved her in a swelling torrent of sheer force that mounted in intensity each moment, until the roar of it beat against her and at last blotted out everything.","",""," Anita blinked. She sat up and automatically pushed her hair into place. Cris was standing before the closet. He was reaching up, getting something down."," He turned toward her and tossed something on the bed. Her heavy metal foil traveling cape."," Anita gazed down at the cape without comprehension. \"What do you want?\""," Cris stood by the bed, waiting."," She picked up the cape uncertainly. Cold creepers of fear plucked at her. \"You want me to get you out of here,\" she said softly. \"Past the guards and the CP.\""," Cris said nothing."," \"They'll kill you instantly.\" She got unsteadily to her feet. \"You can't run past them. Good God, don't you do anything but run? There must be a better way. Maybe I can appeal to Wisdom. I'm Class A -- Director Class. I can go directly to the Full Directorate. I ought to be able to hold them off, keep back the euth indefinitely. The odds are a billion to one against us if we try to break past --\""," She broke off."," \"But you don't gamble,\" she continued slowly. \"You don't go by odds. You know what's coming. You've seen the cards already.\" She studied his face intently. \"No, you can't be cold-decked. It wouldn't be possible.\""," For a moment she stood deep in thought. Then with a quick, decisive motion, she snatched up the cloak and slipped it around her bare shoulders. She fastened the heavy belt, bent down and got her shoes from under the bed, snatched up her purse, and hurried to the door."," \"Come on,\" she said. She was breathing quickly, cheeks flushed. \"Let's go. While there are still a number of exits to choose from. My car is parked outside, in the lot at the side of the building. We can get to my place in an hour. I have a winter home in Argentina. If worse comes to worst we can fly there. It's in the back country, away from the cities. Jungle and swamps. Cut-off from almost everything.\" Eagerly she started to open the door."," Cris reached out and stopped her. Gently, patiently, he moved in front of her."," He waited a long time, body rigid. Then he turned the knob and stepped boldly out into the corridor."," The corridor was empty. No one was in sight. Anita caught a faint glimpse, the back of a guard hurrying off. If they had come out a second earlier --"," Cris started down the corridor. She ran after him. He moved rapidly, effortlessly. The girl had trouble keeping up with him. He seemed to know exactly where to go. Off to the right, down a side hall, a supply passage. Onto an ascent freight-lift. They rose, then abruptly halted."," Cris waited again. Presently he slid the door back and moved out of the lift. Anita followed nervously. She could hear sounds: guns and men, very close."," They were near an exit. A double line of guards stood directly ahead. Twenty men, a solid wall -- and a massive heavy-duty robot gun in the center. The men were alert, faces strained and tense. Watching wide-eyed, guns gripped tight. A Civil Police officer was in charge."," \"We'll never get past,\" Anita gasped. \"We wouldn't get ten feet.\" She pulled back. \"They'll --\""," Cris took her by the arm and continued calmly forward. Blind terror leaped inside her. She fought wildly to get away, but his fingers were like steel. She couldn't pry them loose. Quietly, irresistibly, the great golden creature drew her along beside him toward the double line of guards."," \"There he is!\" Guns went up. Men leaped into action. The barrel of the robot cannon swung around. \"Get him!\""," Anita was paralyzed. She sagged against the powerful body beside her, tugged along helplessly by his inflexible grasp. The lines of guards came nearer, a sheer wall of guns. Anita fought to control her terror. She stumbled, half-fell. Cris supported her effortlessly. She scratched, fought at him, struggled to get loose --"," \"Don't shoot!\" she screamed."," Guns wavered uncertainly. \"Who is she?\" The guards were moving around, trying to get a sight on Cris without including her. \"Who's he got there?\""," One of them saw the stripe on her sleeve. Red and black. Director Class. Top-level."," \"She's Class A.\" Shocked, the guards retreated. \"Miss, get out of the way!\""," Anita found her voice. \"Don't shoot. He's -- in my custody. You understand? I'm taking him out.\""," The wall of guards moved back nervously. \"No one's supposed to pass. Director Wisdom gave orders --\""," \"I'm not subject to Wisdom's authority.\" She managed to edge her voice with a harsh crispness. \"Get out of the way. I'm taking him to the Semantics Agency.\""," For a moment nothing happened. There was no reaction. Then slowly, uncertainly, one guard stepped aside."," Cris moved. A blur of speed, away from Anita, past the confused guards, through the breach in the line, out the exit, and onto the street. Bursts of energy flashed wildly after him. Shouting guards milled out. Anita was left behind, forgotten. The guards, the heavy-duty gun, were pouring out into the early morning darkness. Sirens wailed. Patrol cars roared into life."," Anita stood dazed, confused, leaning against the wall, trying to get her breath."," He was gone. He had left her. Good God -- what had she done? She shook her head, bewildered, her face buried in her hands. She had been hypnotized. She had lost her will, her common sense. Her reason! The animal, the great golden beast, had tricked her. Taken advantage of her. And now he was gone, escaped into the night."," Miserable, agonized tears trickled through her clenched fingers. She rubbed at them futilely; but they kept on coming.","",""," \"He's gone,\" Baines said. \"We'll never get him, now. He's probably a million miles from here.\""," Anita sat huddled in the corner, her face to the wall. A little bent heap, broken and wretched."," Wisdom paced back and forth. \"But where can he go? Where can he hide? Nobody'll hide him! Everybody knows the law about deeves!\""," \"He's lived out in the woods most of his life. He'll hunt -- that's what he's always done. They wondered what he was up to, off by himself. He was catching game and sleeping under trees.\" Baines laughed harshly. \"And the first woman he meets will be glad to hide him -- as she was.\" He indicated Anita with a jerk of his thumb."," \"So all that gold, that mane, that god-like stance, was for something. Not just ornament.\" Wisdom's thick lips twisted. \"He doesn't have just one faculty -- he has two. One is new, the newest thing in survival method. The other is old as life.\" He stopped pacing to glare at the huddled shape in the corner. \"Plumage. Bright feathers, combs for the rooster, swans, birds, bright scales for the fish. Gleaming pelts and manes for the animals. An animal isn't necessarily bestial. Lions aren't bestial. Or tigers. Or any of the big cats. They're anything but bestial.\""," \"He'll never have to worry,\" Baines said. \"He'll get by -- as long as human women exist to take care of him. And since he can see ahead, into the future, he already knows he's sexually irresistible to human females.\""," \"We'll get him,\" Wisdom muttered. \"I've had the Government declare an emergency. Military and Civil Police will be looking for him. Armies of men -- a whole planet of experts, the most advanced machines and equipment. We'll flush him, sooner or later.\""," \"By that time it won't make any difference,\" Baines said. He put his hand on Anita's shoulder and patted her ironically. \"You'll have company, sweetheart. You won't be the only one. You're just the first of a long procession.\""," \"Thanks,\" Anita grated."," \"The oldest survival method and the newest. Combined to form one perfectly adapted animal. How the hell are we going to stop him? We can put you through a sterilization tank -- but we can't pick them all up, all the women he meets along the way. And if we miss one we're finished.\""," \"We'll have to keep trying,\" Wisdom said. \"Round up as many as we can. Before they can spawn.\" Faint hope glinted in his tired, sagging face. \"Maybe his characteristics are recessive. Maybe ours will cancel his out.\""," \"I wouldn't lay any money on that,\" Baines said. \"I think I know already which of the two strains is going to turn up dominant.\" He grinned wryly. \"I mean, I'm making a good guess. It won't be us.\""," "," "],"excerpt":"The powers of earth had finally exterminated the last of the horrible tribes of mutant freaks spawned by atomic war.

He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost."," From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square."," Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands."," It was a body. A human body."," \"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\""," Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there.\""," \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the sky--the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is. How the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\""," Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\""," \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\""," Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\""," Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\""," \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to call the cops.\""," \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be there.\""," \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business before pleasure.\""," Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!\" \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\""," \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\""," \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run. See you later, Ed.\""," Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle--and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention."," \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green."," The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue."," \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with revulsion--and fear."," Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?"," And--why didn't anybody notice?"," He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the man grated. \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\""," Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\""," \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's aim \"You look sick.\""," \"The body. There in the park.\""," \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. \"Take it easy.\""," Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something wrong?\""," \"Ed's not feeling well.\""," Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it? For God's sake--\" \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously."," \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\""," More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\""," \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\""," \"Ed--\""," \"Better get a doctor!\""," \"He must be sick.\""," \"Or drunk.\""," Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmuring around him."," \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something! Something's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\" The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving efficiently toward Loyce."," \"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured."," \"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me. Back there--\""," \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath."," \"1368 Hurst Road.\""," \"That's here in Pikeville?\""," \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost--\""," \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded."," \"Where?\" Loyce echoed."," \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\""," \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\""," \"In the basement?\""," \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame. Why? What has that to do with--\""," \"Was anybody else down there with you?\""," \"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flickered across his face, wild hope. \"You mean because I was down there I missed--the explanation? I didn't get in on it? Like everybody else?\" After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed the explanation.\""," \"Then it's official? The body--it's supposed to be hanging there?\""," \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\""," Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like the Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking over.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands shaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\""," \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of Justice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights had not yet come on."," \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in, is there?\""," The two cops said nothing."," \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of--\" \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short process. Only a few minutes.\""," \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting excited like that and--\""," Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, snouts, people running."," They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small town for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops."," They weren't cops--and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter, Fergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't know--and they didn't care. That was the strange part."," Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the startled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping and panting."," There was no sound behind him. He had got away."," He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and ruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street light wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars."," And to his right--the police station."," He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred windows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get farther away from them."," Them?"," Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the City Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance."," And--something else."," Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky."," He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound. A buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees."," Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over the City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid. In the vortex something moved. Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense swarm and then dropping silently onto the roof."," Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeing--them."," For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool of scummy water."," They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the City Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest--and then crawled crab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building."," He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the City Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on."," Were there more of them?"," It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren't men. They were alien--from some other world, some other dimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being."," On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others."," Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly fluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest among them."," Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration. Mimicry."," Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them."," He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus stops stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the evening gloom."," Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the bus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A moment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street."," Loyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired faces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats, jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A businessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family."," Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white Angora sweater. Gazing absently ahead of her."," A high school boy in jeans and black jacket."," A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness. Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to their families. To dinner."," Going home--with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask of an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their town, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof."," Maybe there were others."," Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down. Apparently their power-zone was limited. A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his chain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache. Well-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly away."," Loyce tensed. One of them? Or--another they had missed?"," The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for them--or one of the things itself, an alien insect from beyond."," The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce."," The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second something passed between them. A look rich with meaning."," Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open."," \"Hey!\" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. \"What the hell--?\""," Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A residential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him, the bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off."," Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book."," Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. \"Stop! For God's sake listen--\""," He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk, up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed man who had come after him."," Had he made a mistake?"," But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out--away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his."," \"Ed!\" Janet Loyce backed away nervously. \"What is it? What--\""," Ed Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. \"Pull down the shades. Quick.\" Janet moved toward the window. \"But--\""," \"Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?\""," \"Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What's happened? You look so strange. Why are you home?\""," Ed locked the front door. He prowled around the house, into the kitchen. From the drawer under the sink he slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it. Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living room."," \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"I don't have much time. They know I escaped and they'll be looking for me.\""," \"Escaped?\" Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. \"Who?\""," \"The town has been taken over. They're in control. I've got it pretty well figured out. They started at the top, at the City Hall and police department. What they did with the real humans they--\""," \"What are you talking about?\""," \"We've been invaded. From some other universe, some other dimension. They're insects. Mimicry. And more. Power to control minds. Your mind.\""," \"My mind?\""," \"Their entrance is here, in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you. The whole town--except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're limited! They can make mistakes!\" Janet shook her head. \"I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane.\""," \"Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement I'd be like all the rest of you.\" Loyce peered out the window. \"But I can't stand here talking. Get your coat.\""," \"My coat?\""," \"We're getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We've got to get help. Fight this thing. They can be beaten. They're not infallible. It's going to be close--but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!\" He grabbed her arm roughly. \"Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving. Don't stop to pack. There's no time for that.\""," White-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat. \"Where are we going?\""," Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. \"They'll have the highway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got onto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about it.\""," \"The old Ranch Road? Good Lord--it's completely closed. Nobody's supposed to drive over it.\""," \"I know.\" Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. \"That's our best chance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of gas, isn't it?\""," Janet was dazed."," \"The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon.\" Janet moved toward the stairs. \"Ed, I--\""," \"Call the twins!\" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life. All right so far."," \"Come on downstairs,\" Janet called in a wavering voice. \"We're--going out for a while.\""," \"Now?\" Tommy's voice came."," \"Hurry up,\" Ed barked. \"Get down here, both of you.\""," Tommy appeared at the top of the stairs. \"I was doing my homework. We're starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don't get this done--\""," \"You can forget about fractions.\" Ed grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. \"Where's Jim?\""," \"He's coming.\""," Jim started slowly down the stairs. \"What's up, Dad?\""," \"We're going for a ride.\""," \"A ride? Where?\""," Ed turned to Janet. \"We'll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn it on.\" He pushed her toward the set. \"So they'll think we're still--\""," He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out. Sickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse--the thing hurtling at him, cold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow T-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange half-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?"," A stinger."," Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down."," Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utter alien presence, settling over him--and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a broken heap on the rug."," It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of some kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy... He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still, neither of them moving."," The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It was ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and open fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone."," Loyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and son. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps."," A moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness toward the edge of town."," The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loyce halted, gasping for breath, swaying back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing was torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled. Ten miles--on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night. His shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly exhausted. But ahead of him lay Oak Grove."," He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and fell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything receded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from Pikeville."," A farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in wonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a gasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens pecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string."," The white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. \"Thank God.\" He caught hold of the wall. \"I didn't think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me.\""," \"What happened?\" the attendant demanded. \"You in a wreck? A holdup?\""," Loyce shook his head wearily. \"They have the whole town. The City Hall and the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the first thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun came up.\""," The attendant licked his lip nervously. \"You're out of your head. I better get a doctor.\""," \"Get me into Oak Grove,\" Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel. \"We've got to get started--cleaning them out. Got to get started right away.\""," They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had finished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet. He stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his cigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face."," \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said."," The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently away. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\" he said abruptly."," Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\""," \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\""," Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a theory,\" he murmured."," \"What is it?\""," \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting at the top--the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a widening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next town. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on for a long time.\""," \"A long time?\""," \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\""," \"Why do you say that?\""," \"When I was a kid... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A religious picture--an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah. Moloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth--\""," \"So?\""," \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the Commissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as--a giant fly.\""," The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\""," \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They make gains--but finally they're defeated.\""," \"Why defeated?\""," \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\""," The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He turned from the window, \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured everything out.\""," \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?\""," \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"Bait.\""," Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\""," \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was under control--and who had escaped.\""," Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they expected failures! They anticipated--\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\" \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The Commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\""," Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man. Who was the man? I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger. All muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed--\""," There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered, \"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with me, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort. A telephone pole--and a rope! \"Right this way,\" the Commissioner said, smiling coldly."," As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came up out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and coat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were there, hurrying home to dinner."," \"Good night,\" the guard said, locking the door after him."," \"Good night,\" Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there was room for another tier. He was glad to be finished."," At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The street was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around--and froze."," From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large and shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind. What the hell was it?"," Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and hungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner table. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous and ugly."," The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew him on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made him uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened--and fascinated."," And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it."],"excerpt":"At five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store.

Two armed soldiers loomed up ahead, one on each side."," \"All right?\" The Speaker looked up at them. They nodded. The door of the Church was open. Conger could see other soldiers inside, standing about, young soldiers with large eyes, gazing at the ikons and holy images."," \"I see,\" he said."," \"It was necessary,\" the Speaker said. \"As you know, we have been singularly unfortunate in the past in our relations with the First Church.\""," \"This won't help.\""," \"But it's worth it. You will see.\"","",""," *****","",""," \"In here. We have to hurry. The faithful will be flocking in soon.\""," Conger entered, blinking. They were in a small chamber, low-ceilinged, with dark panels of old wood. There was a smell of ashes and smoldering spices in the room. He sniffed. \"What's that? The smell.\""," \"Cups on the wall. I don't know.\" The Speaker crossed impatiently to the far side. \"According to our information, it is hidden here by this--\""," Conger looked around the room. He saw books and papers, holy signs and images. A strange low shiver went through him."," \"Does my job involve anyone of the Church? If it does--\""," The Speaker turned, astonished. \"Can it be that you believe in the Founder? Is it possible, a hunter, a killer--\""," \"No. Of course not. All their business about resignation to death, non-violence--\""," \"What is it, then?\""," Conger shrugged. \"I've been taught not to mix with such as these. They have strange abilities. And you can't reason with them.\""," The Speaker studied Conger thoughtfully. \"You have the wrong idea. It is no one here that we have in mind. We've found that killing them only tends to increase their numbers.\""," \"Then why come here? Let's leave.\""," \"No. We came for something important. Something you will need to identify your man. Without it you won't be able to find him.\" A trace of a smile crossed the Speaker's face. \"We don't want you to kill the wrong person. It's too important.\""," \"I don't make mistakes.\" Conger's chest rose. \"Listen, Speaker--\""," \"This is an unusual situation,\" the Speaker said. \"You see, the person you are after--the person that we are sending you to find--is known only by certain objects here. They are the only traces, the only means of identification. Without them--\""," \"What are they?\""," He came toward the Speaker. The Speaker moved to one side. \"Look,\" he said. He drew a sliding wall away, showing a dark square hole. \"In there.\""," Conger squatted down, staring in. He frowned. \"A skull! A skeleton!\""," \"The man you are after has been dead for two centuries,\" the Speaker said. \"This is all that remains of him. And this is all you have with which to find him.\""," For a long time Conger said nothing. He stared down at the bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down?"," Conger was a hunter, a man who had lived as he pleased, where he pleased. He had kept himself alive by trading, bringing furs and pelts in from the Provinces on his own ship, riding at high speed, slipping through the customs line around Earth."," He had hunted in the great mountains of the moon. He had stalked through empty Martian cities. He had explored--"," The Speaker said, \"Soldier, take these objects and have them carried to the car. Don't lose any part of them.\""," The soldier went into the cupboard, reaching gingerly, squatting on his heels."," \"It is my hope,\" the Speaker continued softly, to Conger, \"that you will demonstrate your loyalty to us, now. There are always ways for citizens to restore themselves, to show their devotion to their society. For you I think this would be a very good chance. I seriously doubt that a better one will come. And for your efforts there will be quite a restitution, of course.\""," The two men looked at each other; Conger, thin, unkempt, the Speaker immaculate in his uniform."," \"I understand you,\" Conger said. \"I mean, I understand this part, about the chance. But how can a man who has been dead two centuries be--\""," \"I'll explain later,\" the Speaker said. \"Right now we have to hurry!\" The soldier had gone out with the bones, wrapped in a blanket held carefully in his arms. The Speaker walked to the door. \"Come. They've already discovered that we've broken in here, and they'll be coming at any moment.\""," They hurried down the damp steps to the waiting car. A second later the driver lifted the car up into the air, above the house-tops.","",""," *****","",""," \"The First Church has an interesting past,\" he said. \"I suppose you are familiar with it, but I'd like to speak of a few points that are of relevancy to us."," \"It was in the twentieth century that the Movement began--during one of the periodic wars. The Movement developed rapidly, feeding on the general sense of futility, the realization that each war was breeding greater war, with no end in sight. The Movement posed a simple answer to the problem: Without military preparations--weapons--there could be no war. And without machinery and complex scientific technocracy there could be no weapons."," \"The Movement preached that you couldn't stop war by planning for it. They preached that man was losing to his machinery and science, that it was getting away from him, pushing him into greater and greater wars. Down with society, they shouted. Down with factories and science! A few more wars and there wouldn't be much left of the world."," \"The Founder was an obscure person from a small town in the American Middle West. We don't even know his name. All we know is that one day he appeared, preaching a doctrine of non-violence, non-resistance; no fighting, no paying taxes for guns, no research except for medicine. Live out your life quietly, tending your garden, staying out of public affairs; mind your own business. Be obscure, unknown, poor. Give away most of your possessions, leave the city. At least that was what developed from what he told the people.\""," The car dropped down and landed on a roof."," \"The Founder preached this doctrine, or the germ of it; there's no telling how much the faithful have added themselves. The local authorities picked him up at once, of course. Apparently they were convinced that he meant it; he was never released. He was put to death, and his body buried secretly. It seemed that the cult was finished.\""," The Speaker smiled. \"Unfortunately, some of his disciples reported seeing him after the date of his death. The rumor spread; he had conquered death, he was divine. It took hold, grew. And here we are today, with a First Church, obstructing all social progress, destroying society, sowing the seeds of anarchy--\""," \"But the wars,\" Conger said. \"About them?\""," \"The wars? Well, there were no more wars. It must be acknowledged that the elimination of war was the direct result of non-violence practiced on a general scale. But we can take a more objective view of war today. What was so terrible about it? War had a profound selective value, perfectly in accord with the teachings of Darwin and Mendel and others. Without war the mass of useless, incompetent mankind, without training or intelligence, is permitted to grow and expand unchecked. War acted to reduce their numbers; like storms and earthquakes and droughts, it was nature's way of eliminating the unfit."," \"Without war the lower elements of mankind have increased all out of proportion. They threaten the educated few, those with scientific knowledge and training, the ones equipped to direct society. They have no regard for science or a scientific society, based on reason. And this Movement seeks to aid and abet them. Only when scientists are in full control can the--\"","",""," *****","",""," They crossed the dark roof. \"Doubtless you now know whom those bones belonged to, who it is that we are after. He has been dead just two centuries, now, this ignorant man from the Middle West, this Founder. The tragedy is that the authorities of the time acted too slowly. They allowed him to speak, to get his message across. He was allowed to preach, to start his cult. And once such a thing is under way, there's no stopping it."," \"But what if he had died before he preached? What if none of his doctrines had ever been spoken? It took only a moment for him to utter them, that we know. They say he spoke just once, just one time. Then the authorities came, taking him away. He offered no resistance; the incident was small.\""," The Speaker turned to Conger."," \"Small, but we're reaping the consequences of it today.\""," They went inside the building. Inside, the soldiers had already laid out the skeleton on a table. The soldiers stood around it, their young faces intense."," Conger went over to the table, pushing past them. He bent down, staring at the bones. \"So these are his remains,\" he murmured. \"The Founder. The Church has hidden them for two centuries.\""," \"Quite so,\" the Speaker said. \"But now we have them. Come along down the hall.\""," They went across the room to a door. The Speaker pushed it open. Technicians looked up. Conger saw machinery, whirring and turning; benches and retorts. In the center of the room was a gleaming crystal cage."," The Speaker handed a Slem-gun to Conger. \"The important thing to remember is that the skull must be saved and brought back--for comparison and proof. Aim low--at the chest.\""," Conger weighed the gun in his hands. \"It feels good,\" he said. \"I know this gun--that is, I've seen them before, but I never used one.\""," The Speaker nodded. \"You will be instructed on the use of the gun and the operation of the cage. You will be given all data we have on the time and location. The exact spot was a place called Hudson's field. About 1960 in a small community outside Denver, Colorado. And don't forget--the only means of identification you will have will be the skull. There are visible characteristics of the front teeth, especially the left incisor--\""," Conger listened absently. He was watching two men in white carefully wrapping the skull in a plastic bag. They tied it and carried it into the crystal cage. \"And if I should make a mistake?\""," \"Pick the wrong man? Then find the right one. Don't come back until you succeed in reaching this Founder. And you can't wait for him to start speaking; that's what we must avoid! You must act in advance. Take chances; shoot as soon as you think you've found him. He'll be someone unusual, probably a stranger in the area. Apparently he wasn't known.\""," Conger listened dimly."," \"Do you think you have it all now?\" the Speaker asked."," \"Yes. I think so.\" Conger entered the crystal cage and sat down, placing his hands on the wheel."," \"Good luck,\" the Speaker said."," \"We'll be awaiting the outcome. There's some philosophical doubt as to whether one can alter the past. This should answer the question once and for all.\""," Conger fingered the controls of the cage."," \"By the way,\" the Speaker said. \"Don't try to use this cage for purposes not anticipated in your job. We have a constant trace on it. If we want it back, we can get it back. Good luck.\""," Conger said nothing. The cage was sealed. He raised his finger and touched the wheel control. He turned the wheel carefully."," He was still staring at the plastic bag when the room outside vanished."," For a long time there was nothing at all. Nothing beyond the crystal mesh of the cage. Thoughts rushed through Conger's mind, helter-skelter. How would he know the man? How could he be certain, in advance? What had he looked like? What was his name? How had he acted, before he spoke? Would he be an ordinary person, or some strange outlandish crank?"," Conger picked up the Slem-gun and held it against his cheek. The metal of the gun was cool and smooth. He practiced moving the sight. It was a beautiful gun, the kind of gun he could fall in love with. If he had owned such a gun in the Martian desert--on the long nights when he had lain, cramped and numbed with cold, waiting for things that moved through the darkness--"," He put the gun down and adjusted the meter readings of the cage. The spiraling mist was beginning to condense and settle. All at once forms wavered and fluttered around him."," Colors, sounds, movements filtered through the crystal wire. He clamped the controls off and stood up.","",""," *****","",""," He stood before the mirror over the shelf, examining his features. He had trimmed his beard--they had not got him to cut it off--and his hair was neat. He was dressed in the clothing of the middle-twentieth century, the odd collar and coat, the shoes of animal hide. In his pocket was money of the times. That was important. Nothing more was needed."," Nothing, except his ability, his special cunning. But he had never used it in such a way before."," He walked down the road toward the town."," The first things he noticed were the newspapers on the stands. April 5, 1961. He was not too far off. He looked around him. There was a filling station, a garage, some taverns, and a ten-cent store. Down the street was a grocery store and some public buildings."," A few minutes later he mounted the stairs of the little public library and passed through the doors into the warm interior."," The librarian looked up, smiling."," \"Good afternoon,\" she said."," He smiled, not speaking because his words would not be correct; accented and strange, probably. He went over to a table and sat down by a heap of magazines. For a moment he glanced through them. Then he was on his feet again. He crossed the room to a wide rack against the wall. His heart began to beat heavily."," Newspapers--weeks on end. He took a roll of them over to the table and began to scan them quickly. The print was odd, the letters strange. Some of the words were unfamiliar."," He set the papers aside and searched farther. At last he found what he wanted. He carried the Cherrywood Gazette to the table and opened it to the first page. He found what he wanted:","",""," PRISONER HANGS SELFAn unidentified man, held by the county sheriff's office for suspicion of criminal syndicalism, was found dead this morning, by--"," Gazette","",""," \"More?\" he asked. \"More papers. Old ones?\""," She frowned. \"How old? Which papers?\""," \"Months old. And--before.\""," \"Of the Gazette? This is all we have. What did you want? What are you looking for? Maybe I can help you.\""," He was silent."," \"You might find older issues at the Gazette office,\" the woman said, taking off her glasses. \"Why don't you try there? But if you'd tell me, maybe I could help you--\""," He went out."," The Gazette office was down a side street; the sidewalk was broken and cracked. He went inside. A heater glowed in the corner of the small office. A heavy-set man stood up and came slowly over to the counter."," \"What did you want, mister?\" he said."," \"Old papers. A month. Or more.\""," \"To buy? You want to buy them?\""," \"Yes.\" He held out some of the money he had. The man stared."," \"Sure,\" he said. \"Sure. Wait a minute.\" He went quickly out of the room. When he came back he was staggering under the weight of his armload, his face red. \"Here are some,\" he grunted. \"Took what I could find. Covers the whole year. And if you want more--\""," Conger carried the papers outside. He sat down by the road and began to go through them.","",""," *****","","","",""," MAN ARRESTED FOR UNLICENSED DEMONSTRATIONAn unidentified man who refused to give his name was picked up in Cooper Creek by special agents of the sheriff's office, according to Sheriff Duff. It was said the man was recently noticed in this area and had been watched continually. It was--","",""," He walked back through the main section of town, past the library, past the grocery store. It would not be hard; the hard part was over. He would go there; rent a room, prepare to wait until the man appeared."," He turned the corner. A woman was coming out of a doorway, loaded down with packages. Conger stepped aside to let her pass. The woman glanced at him. Suddenly her face turned white. She stared, her mouth open."," Conger hurried on. He looked back. What was wrong with her? The woman was still staring; she had dropped the packages to the ground. He increased his speed. He turned a second corner and went up a side street. When he looked back again the woman had come to the entrance of the street and was starting after him. A man joined her, and the two of them began to run toward him."," He lost them and left the town, striding quickly, easily, up into the hills at the edge of town. When he reached the cage he stopped. What had happened? Was it something about his clothing? His dress?"," He pondered. Then, as the sun set, he stepped into the cage."," Conger sat before the wheel. For a moment he waited, his hands resting lightly on the control. Then he turned the wheel, just a little, following the control readings carefully."," The grayness settled down around him."," But not for very long.","",""," *****","",""," \"Thanks.\" Conger went gratefully through the open door, into the living-room. It was warm and close from the heat of the little kerosene heater in the corner. A woman, large and shapeless in her flowered dress, came from the kitchen. She and the man studied him critically."," \"It's a good room,\" the woman said. \"I'm Mrs. Appleton. It's got heat. You need that this time of year.\""," \"Yes.\" He nodded, looking around."," \"You want to eat with us?\""," \"What?\""," \"You want to eat with us?\" The man's brows knitted. \"You're not a foreigner, are you, mister?\""," \"No.\" He smiled. \"I was born in this country. Quite far west, though.\""," \"California?\""," \"No.\" He hesitated. \"In Oregon.\""," \"What's it like up there?\" Mrs. Appleton asked. \"I hear there's a lot of trees and green. It's so barren here. I come from Chicago, myself.\""," \"That's the Middle West,\" the man said to her. \"You ain't no foreigner.\""," \"Oregon isn't foreign, either,\" Conger said. \"It's part of the United States.\""," The man nodded absently. He was staring at Conger's clothing."," \"That's a funny suit you got on, mister,\" he said. \"Where'd you get that?\""," Conger was lost. He shifted uneasily. \"It's a good suit,\" he said. \"Maybe I better go some other place, if you don't want me here.\""," They both raised their hands protestingly. The woman smiled at him. \"We just have to look out for those Reds. You know, the government is always warning us about them.\""," \"The Reds?\" He was puzzled."," \"The government says they're all around. We're supposed to report anything strange or unusual, anybody doesn't act normal.\""," \"Like me?\""," They looked embarrassed. \"Well, you don't look like a Red to me,\" the man said. \"But we have to be careful. The Tribune says--\""," Conger half listened. It was going to be easier than he had thought. Clearly, he would know as soon as the Founder appeared. These people, so suspicious of anything different, would be buzzing and gossiping and spreading the story. All he had to do was lie low and listen, down at the general store, perhaps. Or even here, in Mrs. Appleton's boarding house."," \"Can I see the room?\" he said."," \"Certainly.\" Mrs. Appleton went to the stairs. \"I'll be glad to show it to you.\""," They went upstairs. It was colder upstairs, but not nearly as cold as outside. Nor as cold as nights on the Martian deserts. For that he was grateful.","",""," *****","",""," Ed Davies came toward him. \"Can I help you?\" he said. The man was a little oddly dressed, and with a beard! Ed couldn't help smiling."," \"Nothing,\" the man said in a funny voice. \"Just looking.\""," \"Sure,\" Ed said. He walked back behind the counter. Mrs. Hacket was wheeling her cart up."," \"Who's he?\" she whispered, her sharp face turned, her nose moving, as if it were sniffing. \"I never seen him before.\""," \"I don't know.\""," \"Looks funny to me. Why does he wear a beard? No one else wears a beard. Must be something the matter with him.\""," \"Maybe he likes to wear a beard. I had an uncle who--\""," \"Wait.\" Mrs. Hacket stiffened. \"Didn't that--what was his name? The Red--that old one. Didn't he have a beard? Marx. He had a beard.\""," Ed laughed. \"This ain't Karl Marx. I saw a photograph of him once.\""," Mrs. Hacket was staring at him. \"You did?\""," \"Sure.\" He flushed a little. \"What's the matter with that?\""," \"I'd sure like to know more about him,\" Mrs. Hacket said. \"I think we ought to know more, for our own good.\"","",""," *****","",""," Conger turned quickly, dropping his hand to his belt. He relaxed. Two young kids in a car, a girl and a boy. He smiled at them. \"A ride? Sure.\""," Conger got into the car and closed the door. Bill Willet pushed the gas and the car roared down the highway."," \"I appreciate a ride,\" Conger said carefully. \"I was taking a walk between towns, but it was farther than I thought.\""," \"Where are you from?\" Lora Hunt asked. She was pretty, small and dark, in her yellow sweater and blue skirt."," \"From Cooper Creek.\""," \"Cooper Creek?\" Bill said. He frowned. \"That's funny. I don't remember seeing you before.\""," \"Why, do you come from there?\""," \"I was born there. I know everybody there.\""," \"I just moved in. From Oregon.\""," \"From Oregon? I didn't know Oregon people had accents.\""," \"Do I have an accent?\""," \"You use words funny.\""," \"How?\""," \"I don't know. Doesn't he, Lora?\""," \"You slur them,\" Lora said, smiling. \"Talk some more. I'm interested in dialects.\" She glanced at him, white-teethed. Conger felt his heart constrict."," \"I have a speech impediment.\""," \"Oh.\" Her eyes widened. \"I'm sorry.\""," They looked at him curiously as the car purred along. Conger for his part was struggling to find some way of asking them questions without seeming curious. \"I guess people from out of town don't come here much,\" he said. \"Strangers.\""," \"No.\" Bill shook his head. \"Not very much.\""," \"I'll bet I'm the first outsider for a long time.\""," \"I guess so.\""," Conger hesitated. \"A friend of mine--someone I know, might be coming through here. Where do you suppose I might--\" He stopped. \"Would there be anyone certain to see him? Someone I could ask, make sure I don't miss him if he comes?\""," They were puzzled. \"Just keep your eyes open. Cooper Creek isn't very big.\""," \"No. That's right.\""," They drove in silence. Conger studied the outline of the girl. Probably she was the boy's mistress. Perhaps she was his trial wife. Or had they developed trial marriage back so far? He could not remember. But surely such an attractive girl would be someone's mistress by this time; she would be sixteen or so, by her looks. He might ask her sometime, if they ever met again.","",""," *****","",""," He stopped. Lora was sitting inside, talking to the clerk. She was laughing, rocking back and forth."," Conger pushed the door open. Warm air rushed around him. Lora was drinking hot chocolate, with whipped cream. She looked up in surprise as he slid into the seat beside her."," \"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"Am I intruding?\""," \"No.\" She shook her head. Her eyes were large and dark. \"Not at all.\""," The clerk came over. \"What do you want?\""," Conger looked at the chocolate. \"Same as she has.\""," Lora was watching Conger, her arms folded, elbows on the counter. She smiled at him. \"By the way. You don't know my name. Lora Hunt.\""," She was holding out her hand. He took it awkwardly, not knowing what to do with it. \"Conger is my name,\" he murmured."," \"Conger? Is that your last or first name?\""," \"Last or first?\" He hesitated. \"Last. Omar Conger.\""," \"Omar?\" She laughed. \"That's like the poet, Omar Khayyam.\""," \"I don't know of him. I know very little of poets. We restored very few works of art. Usually only the Church has been interested enough--\" He broke off. She was staring. He flushed. \"Where I come from,\" he finished."," \"The Church? Which church do you mean?\""," \"The Church.\" He was confused. The chocolate came and he began to sip it gratefully. Lora was still watching him."," \"You're an unusual person,\" she said. \"Bill didn't like you, but he never likes anything different. He's so--so prosaic. Don't you think that when a person gets older he should become--broadened in his outlook?\""," Conger nodded."," \"He says foreign people ought to stay where they belong, not come here. But you're not so foreign. He means orientals; you know.\""," Conger nodded."," The screen door opened behind them. Bill came into the room. He stared at them. \"Well,\" he said."," Conger turned. \"Hello.\""," \"Well.\" Bill sat down. \"Hello, Lora.\" He was looking at Conger. \"I didn't expect to see you here.\""," Conger tensed. He could feel the hostility of the boy. \"Something wrong with that?\""," \"No. Nothing wrong with it.\""," There was silence. Suddenly Bill turned to Lora. \"Come on. Let's go.\""," \"Go?\" She was astonished. \"Why?\""," \"Just go!\" He grabbed her hand. \"Come on! The car's outside.\""," \"Why, Bill Willet,\" Lora said. \"You're jealous!\""," \"Who is this guy?\" Bill said. \"Do you know anything about him? Look at him, his beard--\""," She flared. \"So what? Just because he doesn't drive a Packard and go to Cooper High!\""," Conger sized the boy up. He was big--big and strong. Probably he was part of some civil control organization."," \"Sorry,\" Conger said. \"I'll go.\""," \"What's your business in town?\" Bill asked. \"What are you doing here? Why are you hanging around Lora?\""," Conger looked at the girl. He shrugged. \"No reason. I'll see you later.\""," He turned away. And froze. Bill had moved. Conger's fingers went to his belt. Half pressure, he whispered to himself. No more. Half pressure."," He squeezed. The room leaped around him. He himself was protected by the lining of his clothing, the plastic sheathing inside."," \"My God--\" Lora put her hands up. Conger cursed. He hadn't meant any of it for her. But it would wear off. There was only a half-amp to it. It would tingle."," Tingle, and paralyze."," He walked out the door without looking back. He was almost to the corner when Bill came slowly out, holding onto the wall like a drunken man. Conger went on.","",""," *****","",""," \"Who is it?\" a man's voice came. Conger waited, tense."," \"Who is it?\" the man said again. He clicked something in his hand. A light flashed. Conger moved."," \"It's me,\" he said."," \"Who is 'me'?\""," \"Conger is my name. I'm staying at the Appleton's place. Who are you?\""," The man came slowly up to him. He was wearing a leather jacket. There was a gun at his waist."," \"I'm Sheriff Duff. I think you're the person I want to talk to. You were in Bloom's today, about three o'clock?\""," \"Bloom's?\""," \"The fountain. Where the kids hang out.\" Duff came up beside him, shining his light into Conger's face. Conger blinked."," \"Turn that thing away,\" he said."," A pause. \"All right.\" The light flickered to the ground. \"You were there. Some trouble broke out between you and the Willet boy. Is that right? You had a beef over his girl--\""," \"We had a discussion,\" Conger said carefully."," \"Then what happened?\""," \"Why?\""," \"I'm just curious. They say you did something.\""," \"Did something? Did what?\""," \"I don't know. That's what I'm wondering. They saw a flash, and something seemed to happen. They all blacked out. Couldn't move.\""," \"How are they now?\""," \"All right.\""," There was silence."," \"Well?\" Duff said. \"What was it? A bomb?\""," \"A bomb?\" Conger laughed. \"No. My cigarette lighter caught fire. There was a leak, and the fluid ignited.\""," \"Why did they all pass out?\""," \"Fumes.\""," Silence. Conger shifted, waiting. His fingers moved slowly toward his belt. The Sheriff glanced down. He grunted."," \"If you say so,\" he said. \"Anyhow, there wasn't any real harm done.\" He stepped back from Conger. \"And that Willet is a trouble-maker.\""," \"Good night, then,\" Conger said. He started past the Sheriff."," \"One more thing, Mr. Conger. Before you go. You don't mind if I look at your identification, do you?\""," \"No. Not at all.\" Conger reached into his pocket. He held his wallet out. The Sheriff took it and shined his flashlight on it. Conger watched, breathing shallowly. They had worked hard on the wallet, studying historic documents, relics of the times, all the papers they felt would be relevant."," Duff handed it back. \"Okay. Sorry to bother you.\" The light winked off."," When Conger reached the house he found the Appletons sitting around the television set. They did not look up as he came in. He lingered at the door."," \"Can I ask you something?\" he said. Mrs. Appleton turned slowly. \"Can I ask you--what's the date?\""," \"The date?\" She studied him. \"The first of December.\""," \"December first! Why, it was just November!\""," They were all looking at him. Suddenly he remembered. In the twentieth century they still used the old twelve-month system. November fed directly into December; there was no Quartember between."," He gasped. Then it was tomorrow! The second of December! Tomorrow!"," \"Thanks,\" he said. \"Thanks.\""," He went up the stairs. What a fool he was, forgetting. The Founder had been taken into captivity on the second of December, according to the newspaper records. Tomorrow, only twelve hours hence, the Founder would appear to speak to the people and then be dragged away.","",""," *****","",""," He stopped to look around. Everything was silent. There was no one in sight. He brought a thin rod from his waist and turned the handle of it. For a moment nothing happened. Then there was a shimmering in the air."," The crystal cage appeared and settled slowly down. Conger sighed. It was good to see it again. After all, it was his only way back."," He walked up on the ridge. He looked around with some satisfaction, his hands on his hips. Hudson's field was spread out, all the way to the beginning of town. It was bare and flat, covered with a thin layer of snow."," Here, the Founder would come. Here, he would speak to them. And here the authorities would take him."," Only he would be dead before they came. He would be dead before he even spoke."," Conger returned to the crystal globe. He pushed through the door and stepped inside. He took the Slem-gun from the shelf and screwed the bolt into place. It was ready to go, ready to fire. For a moment he considered. Should he have it with him?"," No. It might be hours before the Founder came, and suppose someone approached him in the meantime? When he saw the Founder coming toward the field, then he could go and get the gun."," Conger looked toward the shelf. There was the neat plastic package. He took it down and unwrapped it."," He held the skull in his hands, turning it over. In spite of himself, a cold feeling rushed through him. This was the man's skull, the skull of the Founder, who was still alive, who would come here, this day, who would stand on the field not fifty yards away."," What if he could see this, his own skull, yellow and eroded? Two centuries old. Would he still speak? Would he speak, if he could see it, the grinning, aged skull? What would there be for him to say, to tell the people? What message could he bring?"," What action would not be futile, when a man could look upon his own aged, yellowed skull? Better they should enjoy their temporary lives, while they still had them to enjoy."," A man who could hold his own skull in his hands would believe in few causes, few movements. Rather, he would preach the opposite--"," A sound. Conger dropped the skull back on the shelf and took up the gun. Outside something was moving. He went quickly to the door, his heart beating. Was it he? Was it the Founder, wandering by himself in the cold, looking for a place to speak? Was he meditating over his words, choosing his sentences?"," What if he could see what Conger had held!"," He pushed the door open, the gun raised."," Lora!"," He stared at her. She was dressed in a wool jacket and boots, her hands in her pockets. A cloud of steam came from her mouth and nostrils. Her breast was rising and falling."," Silently, they looked at each other. At last Conger lowered the gun."," \"What is it?\" he said. \"What are you doing here?\""," She pointed. She did not seem able to speak. He frowned; what was wrong with her?"," \"What is it?\" he said. \"What do you want?\" He looked in the direction she had pointed. \"I don't see anything.\""," \"They're coming.\""," \"They? Who? Who are coming?\""," \"They are. The police. During the night the Sheriff had the state police send cars. All around, everywhere. Blocking the roads. There's about sixty of them coming. Some from town, some around behind.\" She stopped, gasping. \"They said--they said--\""," \"What?\""," \"They said you were some kind of a Communist. They said--\"","",""," *****","",""," \"Thanks. You came here to tell me? You don't believe it?\""," \"I don't know.\""," \"Did you come alone?\""," \"No. Joe brought me in his truck. From town.\""," \"Joe? Who's he?\""," \"Joe French. The plumber. He's a friend of Dad's.\""," \"Let's go.\" They crossed the snow, up the ridge and onto the field. The little panel truck was parked half way across the field. A heavy short man was sitting behind the wheel, smoking his pipe. He sat up as he saw the two of them coming toward him."," \"Are you the one?\" he said to Conger."," \"Yes. Thanks for warning me.\""," The plumber shrugged. \"I don't know anything about this. Lora says you're all right.\" He turned around. \"It might interest you to know some more of them are coming. Not to warn you--just curious.\""," \"More of them?\" Conger looked toward the town. Black shapes were picking their way across the snow."," \"People from the town. You can't keep this sort of thing quiet, not in a small town. We all listen to the police radio; they heard the same way Lora did. Someone tuned in, spread it around--\""," The shapes were getting closer. Conger could, make out a couple of them. Bill Willet was there, with some boys from the high school. The Appletons were along, hanging back in the rear."," \"Even Ed Davies,\" Conger murmured."," The storekeeper was toiling onto the field, with three or four other men from the town."," \"All curious as hell,\" French said. \"Well, I guess I'm going back to town. I don't want my truck shot full of holes. Come on, Lora.\""," She was looking up at Conger, wide-eyed."," \"Come on,\" French said again. \"Let's go. You sure as hell can't stay here, you know.\""," \"Why?\""," \"There may be shooting. That's what they all came to see. You know that don't you, Conger?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"You have a gun? Or don't you care?\" French smiled a little. \"They've picked up a lot of people in their time, you know. You won't be lonely.\""," He cared, all right! He had to stay here, on the field. He couldn't afford to let them take him away. Any minute the Founder would appear, would step onto the field. Would he be one of the townsmen, standing silently at the foot of the field, waiting, watching?"," Or maybe he was Joe French. Or maybe one of the cops. Anyone of them might find himself moved to speak. And the few words spoken this day were going to be important for a long time."," And Conger had to be there, ready when the first word was uttered!"," \"I care,\" he said. \"You go on back to town. Take the girl with you.\""," Lora got stiffly in beside Joe French. The plumber started up the motor. \"Look at them, standing there,\" he said. \"Like vultures. Waiting to see someone get killed.\"","",""," *****","",""," He could get away, of course. Anytime he wanted to he could get away. All he had to do was to leap into the crystal cage and turn the handles. But he had a job, an important job. He had to be here, here at this place, at this time."," He reached the cage and opened the door. He went inside and picked up the gun from the shelf. The Slem-gun would take care of them. He notched it up to full count. The chain reaction from it would flatten them all, the police, the curious, sadistic people--"," They wouldn't take him! Before they got him, all of them would be dead. He would get away. He would escape. By the end of the day they would all be dead, if that was what they wanted, and he--"," He saw the skull."," Suddenly he put the gun down. He picked up the skull. He turned the skull over. He looked at the teeth. Then he went to the mirror."," He held the skull up, looking in the mirror. He pressed the skull against his cheek. Beside his own face the grinning skull leered back at him, beside his skull, against his living flesh."," He bared his teeth. And he knew."," It was his own skull that he held. He was the one who would die. He was the Founder."," After a time he put the skull down. For a few minutes he stood at the controls, playing with them idly. He could hear the sound of motors outside, the muffled noise of men. Should he go back to the present, where the Speaker waited? He could escape, of course--"," Escape?"," He turned toward the skull. There it was, his skull, yellow with age. Escape? Escape, when he had held it in his own hands?"," What did it matter if he put it off a month, a year, ten years, even fifty? Time was nothing. He had sipped chocolate with a girl born a hundred and fifty years before his time. Escape? For a little while, perhaps."," But he could not really escape, no more so than anyone else had ever escaped, or ever would."," Only, he had held it in his hands, his own bones, his own death's-head."," They had not."," He went out the door and across the field, empty handed. There were a lot of them standing around, gathered together, waiting. They expected a good fight; they knew he had something. They had heard about the incident at the fountain."," And there were plenty of police--police with guns and tear gas, creeping across the hills and ridges, between the trees, closer and closer. It was an old story, in this century."," One of the men tossed something at him. It fell in the snow by his feet, and he looked down. It was a rock. He smiled."," \"Come on!\" one of them called. \"Don't you have any bombs?\""," \"Throw a bomb! You with the beard! Throw a bomb!\""," \"Let 'em have it!\""," \"Toss a few A Bombs!\"","",""," *****","",""," \"I'm sorry,\" he said simply. \"I don't have any bombs. You're mistaken.\""," There was a flurry of murmuring."," \"I have a gun,\" he went on. \"A very good one. Made by science even more advanced than your own. But I'm not going to use that, either.\""," They were puzzled."," \"Why not?\" someone called. At the edge of the group an older woman was watching. He felt a sudden shock. He had seen her before. Where?"," He remembered. The day at the library. As he had turned the corner he had seen her. She had noticed him and been astounded. At the time, he did not understand why."," Conger grinned. So he would escape death, the man who right now was voluntarily accepting it. They were laughing, laughing at a man who had a gun but didn't use it. But by a strange twist of science he would appear again, a few months later, after his bones had been buried under the floor of a jail."," And so, in a fashion, he would escape death. He would die, but then, after a period of months, he would live again, briefly, for an afternoon."," An afternoon. Yet long enough for them to see him, to understand that he was still alive. To know that somehow he had returned to life."," And then, finally, he would appear once more, after two hundred years had passed. Two centuries later."," He would be born again, born, as a matter of fact, in a small trading village on Mars. He would grow up, learning to hunt and trade--"," A police car came on the edge of the field and stopped. The people retreated a little. Conger raised his hands."," \"I have an odd paradox for you,\" he said. \"Those who take lives will lose their own. Those who kill, will die. But he who gives his own life away will live again!\""," They laughed, faintly, nervously. The police were coming out, walking toward him. He smiled. He had said everything he intended to say. It was a good little paradox he had coined. They would puzzle over it, remember it."," Smiling, Conger awaited a death foreordained.","",""," "," "],"excerpt":"Conger agreed to kill a stranger he had never seen.

Council guards stepped quickly aside and he entered the familiar place of great whirring machines. His thin face rapt, eyes alight with emotion, Reinhart gazed intently up at the central SRB computer, studying its reading."," \"Straight gain for the last quarter,\" observed Kaplan, the lab organizer. He grinned proudly, as if personally responsible. \"Not bad, Commissioner.\""," \"We're catching up to them,\" Reinhart retorted. \"But too damn slowly. We must finally go over--and soon.\""," Kaplan was in a talkative mood. \"We design new offensive weapons, they counter with improved defenses. And nothing is actually made!

Design and discord. Immediate obsolescence. Nothing lasts long enough to--\""," \"What we count on is the lag,\" Reinhart broke in, annoyed. His hard gray eyes bored into the lab organizer and Kaplan slunk back. \"The time lag between our offensive design and their counter development. The lag varies.\" He waved impatiently toward the massed banks of SRB machines. \"As you well know.\""," At this moment, 9:30 AM, May 7, 2136, the statistical ratio on the SRB machines stood at 21-17 on the Centauran side of the ledger. All facts considered, the odds favored a successful repulsion by Proxima Centaurus of a Terran military attack. The ratio was based on the total information known to the SRB machines, on a gestalt of the vast flow of data that poured in endlessly from all sectors of the Sol and Centaurus systems."," 21-17 on the Centauran side. But a month ago it had been 24-18 in the enemy's favor. Things were improving, slowly but steadily. Centaurus, older and less virile than Terra, was unable to match Terra's rate of technocratic advance. Terra was pulling ahead."," \"If we went to war now,\" Reinhart said thoughtfully, \"we would lose. We're not far enough along to risk an overt attack.\" A harsh, ruthless glow twisted across his handsome features, distorting them into a stern mask. \"But the odds are moving in our favor. Our offensive designs are gradually gaining on their defenses.\""," \"Let's hope the war comes soon,\" Kaplan agreed. \"We're all on edge. This damn waiting....\""," The war would come soon. Reinhart knew it intuitively. The air was full of tension, the elan. He left the SRB rooms and hurried down the corridor to his own elaborately guarded office in the Security wing. It wouldn't be long. He could practically feel the hot breath of destiny on his neck--for him a pleasant feeling. His thin lips set in a humorless smile, showing an even line of white teeth against his tanned skin. It made him feel good, all right. He'd been working at it a long time."," First contact, a hundred years earlier, had ignited instant conflict between Proxima Centauran outposts and exploring Terran raiders. Flash fights, sudden eruptions of fire and energy beams."," And then the long, dreary years of inaction between enemies where contact required years of travel, even at nearly the speed of light. The two systems were evenly matched. Screen against screen. Warship against power station. The Centauran Empire surrounded Terra, an iron ring that couldn't be broken, rusty and corroded as it was. Radical new weapons had to be conceived, if Terra was to break out."," Through the windows of his office, Reinhart could see endless buildings and streets, Terrans hurrying back and forth. Bright specks that were commute ships, little eggs that carried businessmen and white-collar workers around. The huge transport tubes that shot masses of workmen to factories and labor camps from their housing units. All these people, waiting to break out. Waiting for the day."," Reinhart snapped on his vidscreen, the confidential channel. \"Give me Military Designs,\" he ordered sharply."," *****"," He sat tense, his wiry body taut, as the vidscreen warmed into life. Abruptly he was facing the hulking image of Peter Sherikov, director of the vast network of labs under the Ural Mountains."," Sherikov's great bearded features hardened as he recognized Reinhart. His bushy black eyebrows pulled up in a sullen line. \"What do you want? You know I'm busy. We have too much work to do, as it is. Without being bothered by--politicians.\""," \"I'm dropping over your way,\" Reinhart answered lazily. He adjusted the cuff of his immaculate gray cloak. \"I want a full description of your work and whatever progress you've made.\""," \"You'll find a regular departmental report plate filed in the usual way, around your office someplace. If you'll refer to that you'll know exactly what we--\""," \"I'm not interested in that. I want to see what you're doing. And I expect you to be prepared to describe your work fully. I'll be there shortly. Half an hour.\""," *****"," Reinhart cut the circuit. Sherikov's heavy features dwindled and faded. Reinhart relaxed, letting his breath out. Too bad he had to work with Sherikov. He had never liked the man. The big Polish scientist was an individualist, refusing to integrate himself with society. Independent, atomistic in outlook. He held concepts of the individual as an end, diametrically contrary to the accepted organic state Weltansicht."," But Sherikov was the leading research scientist, in charge of the Military Designs Department. And on Designs the whole future of Terra depended. Victory over Centaurus--or more waiting, bottled up in the Sol System, surrounded by a rotting, hostile Empire, now sinking into ruin and decay, yet still strong."," Reinhart got quickly to his feet and left the office. He hurried down the hall and out of the Council building."," A few minutes later he was heading across the mid-morning sky in his highspeed cruiser, toward the Asiatic land-mass, the vast Ural mountain range. Toward the Military Designs labs."," Sherikov met him at the entrance. \"Look here, Reinhart. Don't think you're going to order me around. I'm not going to--\""," \"Take it easy.\" Reinhart fell into step beside the bigger man. They passed through the check and into the auxiliary labs. \"No immediate coercion will be exerted over you or your staff. You're free to continue your work as you see fit--for the present. Let's get this straight. My concern is to integrate your work with our total social needs. As long as your work is sufficiently productive--\""," Reinhart stopped in his tracks."," \"Pretty, isn't he?\" Sherikov said ironically."," \"What the hell is it?"," \"Icarus, we call him. Remember the Greek myth? The legend of Icarus. Icarus flew.... This Icarus is going to fly, one of these days.\" Sherikov shrugged. \"You can examine him, if you want. I suppose this is what you came here to see.\""," Reinhart advanced slowly. \"This is the weapon you've been working on?\""," \"How does he look?\""," Rising up in the center of the chamber was a squat metal cylinder, a great ugly cone of dark gray. Technicians circled around it, wiring up the exposed relay banks. Reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes and filaments, a maze of wires and terminals and parts criss-crossing each other, layer on layer."," \"What is it?\" Reinhart perched on the edge of a workbench, leaning his big shoulders against the wall. \"An idea of Jamison Hedge--the same man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years ago. He was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when he was killed, destroyed along with most of his work. After that ftl research was abandoned. It looked as if there were no future in it.\""," \"Wasn't it shown that nothing could travel faster than light?\""," \"The interstellar vidcasts do! No, Hedge developed a valid ftl drive. He managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light. But as the object gained speed, its length began to diminish and its mass increased. This was in line with familiar twentieth-century concepts of mass-energy transformation. We conjectured that as Hedge's object gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until its length became nil and its mass infinite. Nobody can imagine such an object.\""," \"Go on.\""," \"But what actually occurred is this. Hedge's object continued to lose length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of velocity, the speed of light. At that point the object, still gaining speed, simply ceased to exist. Having no length, it ceased to occupy space. It disappeared. However, the object had not been destroyed. It continued on its way, gaining momentum each moment, moving in an arc across the galaxy, away from the Sol system. Hedge's object entered some other realm of being, beyond our powers of conception. The next phase of Hedge's experiment consisted in a search for some way to slow the ftl object down, back to a sub-ftl speed, hence back into our universe. This counterprinciple was eventually worked out.\""," \"With what result?\""," \"The death of Hedge and destruction of most of his equipment. His experimental object, in re-entering the space-time universe, came into being in space already occupied by matter. Possessing an incredible mass, just below infinity level, Hedge's object exploded in a titanic cataclysm. It was obvious that no space travel was possible with such a drive. Virtually all space contains some matter. To re-enter space would bring automatic destruction. Hedge had found his ftl drive and his counterprinciple, but no one before this has been able to put them to any use.\""," Reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder. Sherikov jumped down and followed him. \"I don't get it,\" Reinhart said. \"You said the principle is no good for space travel.\""," \"That's right.\""," \"What's this for, then? If the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe--\""," \"This is not a ship.\" Sherikov grinned slyly. \"Icarus is the first practical application of Hedge's principles. Icarus is a bomb.\""," \"So this is our weapon,\" Reinhart said. \"A bomb. An immense bomb.\""," \"A bomb, moving at a velocity greater than light. A bomb which will not exist in our universe. The Centaurans won't be able to detect or stop it. How could they? As soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to exist--beyond all detection.\""," \"But--\""," \"Icarus will be launched outside the lab, on the surface. He will align himself with Proxima Centaurus, gaining speed rapidly. By the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl-100. Icarus will be brought back to this universe within Centaurus itself. The explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planets--including their central hub-planet, Armun. There is no way they can halt Icarus, once he has been launched. No defense is possible. Nothing can stop him. It is a real fact.\""," \"When will he be ready?\""," Sherikov's eyes flickered. \"Soon.\""," \"Exactly how soon?\""," The big Pole hesitated. \"As a matter of fact, there's only one thing holding us back.\""," Sherikov led Reinhart around to the other side of the lab. He pushed a lab guard out of the way."," \"See this?\" He tapped a round globe, open at one end, the size of a grapefruit. \"This is holding us up.\""," \"What is it?\""," \"The central control turret. This thing brings Icarus back to sub-ftl flight at the correct moment. It must be absolutely accurate. Icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond. If the turret does not function exactly, Icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the Centauran system.\""," \"How near completed is this turret?\""," Sherikov hedged uncertainly, spreading out his big hands. \"Who can say? It must be wired with infinitely minute equipment--microscope grapples and wires invisible to the naked eye.\""," \"Can you name any completion date?\""," Sherikov reached into his coat and brought out a manila folder. \"I've drawn up the data for the SRB machines, giving a date of completion. You can go ahead and feed it. I entered ten days as the maximum period. The machines can work from that.\""," Reinhart accepted the folder cautiously. \"You're sure about the date? I'm not convinced I can trust you, Sherikov.\""," Sherikov's features darkened. \"You'll have to take a chance, Commissioner. I don't trust you any more than you trust me. I know how much you'd like an excuse to get me out of here and one of your puppets in.\""," Reinhart studied the huge scientist thoughtfully. Sherikov was going to be a hard nut to crack. Designs was responsible to Security, not the Council. Sherikov was losing ground--but he was still a potential danger. Stubborn, individualistic, refusing to subordinate his welfare to the general good."," \"All right.\" Reinhart put the folder slowly away in his coat. \"I'll feed it. But you better be able to come through. There can't be any slip-ups. Too much hangs on the next few days.\""," \"If the odds change in our favor are you going to give the mobilization order?\""," \"Yes,\" Reinhart stated. \"I'll give the order the moment I see the odds change.\""," *****"," Standing in front of the machines, Reinhart waited nervously for the results. It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The day was warm, a pleasant May afternoon. Outside the building the daily life of the planet went on as usual."," As usual? Not exactly. The feeling was in the air, an expanding excitement growing every day. Terra had waited a long time. The attack on Proxima Centaurus had to come--and the sooner the better. The ancient Centauran Empire hemmed in Terra, bottled the human race up in its one system. A vast, suffocating net draped across the heavens, cutting Terra off from the bright diamonds beyond.... And it had to end."," The SRB machines whirred, the visible combination disappearing. For a time no ratio showed. Reinhart tensed, his body rigid. He waited."," The new ratio appeared."," Reinhart gasped. 7-6. Toward Terra!"," Within five minutes the emergency mobilization alert had been flashed to all Government departments. The Council and President Duffe had been called to immediate session. Everything was happening fast."," But there was no doubt. 7-6. In Terra's favor. Reinhart hurried frantically to get his papers in order, in time for the Council session."," At histo-research the message plate was quickly pulled from the confidential slot and rushed across the central lab to the chief official."," \"Look at this!\" Fredman dropped the plate on his superior's desk. \"Look at it!\""," Harper picked up the plate, scanning it rapidly. \"Sounds like the real thing. I didn't think we'd live to see it.\""," Fredman left the room, hurrying down the hall. He entered the time bubble office. \"Where's the bubble?\" he demanded, looking around."," One of the technicians looked slowly up. \"Back about two hundred years. We're coming up with interesting data on the War of 1914. According to material the bubble has already brought up--\""," \"Cut it. We're through with routine work. Get the bubble back to the present. From now on all equipment has to be free for Military work.\""," \"But--the bubble is regulated automatically.\""," \"You can bring it back manually.\""," \"It's risky.\" The technician hedged. \"If the emergency requires it, I suppose we could take a chance and cut the automatic.\""," \"The emergency requires everything,\" Fredman said feelingly."," \"But the odds might change back,\" Margaret Duffe, President of the Council, said nervously. \"Any minute they can revert.\""," \"This is our chance!\" Reinhart snapped, his temper rising. \"What the hell's the matter with you? We've waited years for this.\""," The Council buzzed with excitement. Margaret Duffe hesitated uncertainly, her blue eyes clouded with worry. \"I realize the opportunity is here. At least, statistically. But the new odds have just appeared. How do we know they'll last? They stand on the basis of a single weapon.\""," \"You're wrong. You don't grasp the situation.\" Reinhart held himself in check with great effort. \"Sherikov's weapon tipped the ratio in our favor. But the odds have been moving in our direction for months. It was only a question of time. The new balance was inevitable, sooner or later. It's not just Sherikov. He's only one factor in this. It's all nine planets of the Sol System--not a single man.\""," One of the Councilmen stood up. \"The President must be aware the entire planet is eager to end this waiting. All our activities for the past eighty years have been directed toward--\""," Reinhart moved close to the slender President of the Council. \"If you don't approve the war, there probably will be mass rioting. Public reaction will be strong. Damn strong. And you know it.\""," Margaret Duffe shot him a cold glance. \"You sent out the emergency order to force my hand. You were fully aware of what you were doing. You knew once the order was out there'd be no stopping things.\""," A murmur rushed through the Council, gaining volume. \"We have to approve the war!... We're committed!... It's too late to turn back!\""," Shouts, angry voices, insistent waves of sound lapped around Margaret Duffe. \"I'm as much for the war as anybody,\" she said sharply. \"I'm only urging moderation. An inter-system war is a big thing. We're going to war because a machine says we have a statistical chance of winning.\""," \"There's no use starting the war unless we can win it,\" Reinhart said. \"The SRB machines tell us whether we can win.\""," \"They tell us our chance of winning. They don't guarantee anything.\""," \"What more can we ask, beside a good chance of winning?\""," Margaret Duffe clamped her jaw together tightly. \"All right. I hear all the clamor. I won't stand in the way of Council approval. The vote can go ahead.\" Her cold, alert eyes appraised Reinhart. \"Especially since the emergency order has already been sent out to all Government departments.\""," \"Good.\" Reinhart stepped away with relief. \"Then it's settled. We can finally go ahead with full mobilization.\""," Mobilization proceeded rapidly. The next forty-eight hours were alive with activity."," Reinhart attended a policy-level Military briefing in the Council rooms, conducted by Fleet Commander Carleton."," \"You can see our strategy,\" Carleton said. He traced a diagram on the blackboard with a wave of his hand. \"Sherikov states it'll take eight more days to complete the ftl bomb. During that time the fleet we have near the Centauran system will take up positions. As the bomb goes off the fleet will begin operations against the remaining Centauran ships. Many will no doubt survive the blast, but with Armun gone we should be able to handle them.\""," Reinhart took Commander Carleton's place. \"I can report on the economic situation. Every factory on Terra is converted to arms production. With Armun out of the way we should be able to promote mass insurrection among the Centauran colonies. An inter-system Empire is hard to maintain, even with ships that approach light speed. Local war-lords should pop up all over the place. We want to have weapons available for them and ships starting now to reach them in time. Eventually we hope to provide a unifying principle around which the colonies can all collect. Our interest is more economic than political. They can have any kind of government they want, as long as they act as supply areas for us. As our eight system planets act now.\""," Carleton resumed his report. \"Once the Centauran fleet has been scattered we can begin the crucial stage of the war. The landing of men and supplies from the ships we have waiting in all key areas throughout the Centauran system. In this stage--\""," Reinhart moved away. It was hard to believe only two days had passed since the mobilization order had been sent out. The whole system was alive, functioning with feverish activity. Countless problems were being solved--but much remained."," He entered the lift and ascended to the SRB room, curious to see if there had been any change in the machines' reading. He found it the same. So far so good. Did the Centaurans know about Icarus? No doubt; but there wasn't anything they could do about it. At least, not in eight days."," Kaplan came over to Reinhart, sorting a new batch of data that had come in. The lab organizer searched through his data. \"An amusing item came in. It might interest you.\" He handed a message plate to Reinhart."," It was from histo-research:","                            May 9, 2136","","    This is to report that in bringing the research time bubble up     to the present the manual return was used for the first time.     Therefore a clean break was not made, and a quantity of     material from the past was brought forward. This material     included an individual from the early twentieth century who     escaped from the lab immediately. He has not yet been taken     into protective custody. Histo-research regrets this incident,     but attributes it to the emergency.","","                                                        E. Fredman",""," Reinhart handed the plate back to Kaplan. \"Interesting. A man from the past--hauled into the middle of the biggest war the universe has seen.\""," \"Strange things happen. I wonder what the machines will think.\""," \"Hard to say. Probably nothing.\" Reinhart left the room and hurried along the corridor to his own office."," As soon as he was inside he called Sherikov on the vidscreen, using the confidential line."," The Pole's heavy features appeared. \"Good day, Commissioner. How's the war effort?\""," \"Fine. How's the turret wiring proceeding?\""," A faint frown flickered across Sherikov's face. \"As a matter of fact, Commissioner--\""," \"What's the matter?\" Reinhart said sharply."," Sherikov floundered. \"You know how these things are. I've taken my crew off it and tried robot workers. They have greater dexterity, but they can't make decisions. This calls for more than mere dexterity. This calls for--\" He searched for the word. \"--for an artist.\""," Reinhart's face hardened. \"Listen, Sherikov. You have eight days left to complete the bomb. The data given to the SRB machines contained that information. The 7-6 ratio is based on that estimate. If you don't come through--\""," Sherikov twisted in embarrassment. \"Don't get excited, Commissioner. We'll complete it.\""," \"I hope so. Call me as soon as it's done.\" Reinhart snapped off the connection. If Sherikov let them down he'd have him taken out and shot. The whole war depended on the ftl bomb."," The vidscreen glowed again. Reinhart snapped it on. Kaplan's face formed on it. The lab organizer's face was pale and frozen. \"Commissioner, you better come up to the SRB office. Something's happened.\""," \"What is it?\""," \"I'll show you.\""," Alarmed, Reinhart hurried out of his office and down the corridor. He found Kaplan standing in front of the SRB machines. \"What's the story?\" Reinhart demanded. He glanced down at the reading. It was unchanged."," Kaplan held up a message plate nervously. \"A moment ago I fed this into the machines. After I saw the results I quickly removed it. It's that item I showed you. From histo-research. About the man from the past.\""," \"What happened when you fed it?\""," Kaplan swallowed unhappily. \"I'll show you. I'll do it again. Exactly as before.\" He fed the plate into a moving intake belt. \"Watch the visible figures,\" Kaplan muttered."," Reinhart watched, tense and rigid. For a moment nothing happened. 7-6 continued to show. Then--"," The figures disappeared. The machines faltered. New figures showed briefly. 4-24 for Centaurus. Reinhart gasped, suddenly sick with apprehension. But the figures vanished. New figures appeared. 16-38 for Centaurus. Then 48-86. 79-15 in Terra's favor. Then nothing. The machines whirred, but nothing happened."," Nothing at all. No figures. Only a blank."," \"What's it mean?\" Reinhart muttered, dazed."," \"It's fantastic. We didn't think this could--\""," \"What's happened?\""," \"The machines aren't able to handle the item. No reading can come. It's data they can't integrate. They can't use it for prediction material, and it throws off all their other figures.\""," \"Why?\""," \"It's--it's a variable.\" Kaplan was shaking, white-lipped and pale. \"Something from which no inference can be made. The man from the past. The machines can't deal with him. The variable man!\"","",""," II","",""," The knife belonged to the lady in the big green house. Every time Cole came by with his Fixit cart the lady had something to be sharpened. Once in awhile she gave him a cup of coffee, hot black coffee from an old bent pot. He liked that fine; he enjoyed good coffee."," The day was drizzly and overcast. Business had been bad. An automobile had scared his two horses. On bad days less people were outside and he had to get down from the cart and go to ring doorbells."," But the man in the yellow house had given him a dollar for fixing his electric refrigerator. Nobody else had been able to fix it, not even the factory man. The dollar would go a long way. A dollar was a lot."," He knew it was a tornado even before it hit him. Everything was silent. He was bent over his whetstone, the reins between his knees, absorbed in his work."," He had done a good job on the knife; he was almost finished. He spat on the blade and was holding it up to see--and then the tornado came."," All at once it was there, completely around him. Nothing but grayness. He and the cart and horses seemed to be in a calm spot in the center of the tornado. They were moving in a great silence, gray mist everywhere."," And while he was wondering what to do, and how to get the lady's knife back to her, all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him over, sprawled out on the ground. The horses screamed in fear, struggling to pick themselves up. Cole got quickly to his feet."," Where was he?"," The grayness was gone. White walls stuck up on all sides. A deep light gleamed down, not daylight but something like it. The team was pulling the cart on its side, dragging it along, tools and equipment falling out. Cole righted the cart, leaping up onto the seat."," And for the first time saw the people."," Men, with astonished white faces, in some sort of uniforms. Shouts, noise and confusion. And a feeling of danger!"," Cole headed the team toward the door. Hoofs thundered steel against steel as they pounded through the doorway, scattering the astonished men in all directions. He was out in a wide hall. A building, like a hospital."," The hall divided. More men were coming, spilling from all sides."," Shouting and milling in excitement, like white ants. Something cut past him, a beam of dark violet. It seared off a corner of the cart, leaving the wood smoking."," Cole felt fear. He kicked at the terrified horses. They reached a big door, crashing wildly against it. The door gave--and they were outside, bright sunlight blinking down on them. For a sickening second the cart tilted, almost turning over. Then the horses gained speed, racing across an open field, toward a distant line of green, Cole holding tightly to the reins."," Behind him the little white-faced men had come out and were standing in a group, gesturing frantically. He could hear their faint shrill shouts."," But he had got away. He was safe. He slowed the horses down and began to breathe again."," The woods were artificial. Some kind of park. But the park was wild and overgrown. A dense jungle of twisted plants. Everything growing in confusion."," The park was empty. No one was there. By the position of the sun he could tell it was either early morning or late afternoon. The smell of the flowers and grass, the dampness of the leaves, indicated morning. It had been late afternoon when the tornado had picked him up. And the sky had been overcast and cloudy."," Cole considered. Clearly, he had been carried a long way. The hospital, the men with white faces, the odd lighting, the accented words he had caught--everything indicated he was no longer in Nebraska--maybe not even in the United States."," Some of his tools had fallen out and gotten lost along the way. Cole collected everything that remained, sorting them, running his fingers over each tool with affection. Some of the little chisels and wood gouges were gone. The bit box had opened, and most of the smaller bits had been lost. He gathered up those that remained and replaced them tenderly in the box. He took a key-hole saw down, and with an oil rag wiped it carefully and replaced it."," Above the cart the sun rose slowly in the sky. Cole peered up, his horny hand over his eyes. A big man, stoop-shouldered, his chin gray and stubbled. His clothes wrinkled and dirty. But his eyes were clear, a pale blue, and his hands were finely made."," He could not stay in the park. They had seen him ride that way; they would be looking for him."," Far above something shot rapidly across the sky. A tiny black dot moving with incredible haste. A second dot followed. The two dots were gone almost before he saw them. They were utterly silent."," Cole frowned, perturbed. The dots made him uneasy. He would have to keep moving--and looking for food. His stomach was already beginning to rumble and groan."," Work. There was plenty he could do: gardening, sharpening, grinding, repair work on machines and clocks, fixing all kinds of household things. Even painting and odd jobs and carpentry and chores."," He could do anything. Anything people wanted done. For a meal and pocket money."," Thomas Cole urged the team into life, moving forward. He sat hunched over in the seat, watching intently, as the Fixit cart rolled slowly across the tangled grass, through the jungle of trees and flowers."," *****"," Reinhart hurried, racing his cruiser at top speed, followed by a second ship, a military escort. The ground sped by below him, a blur of gray and green."," The remains of New York lay spread out, a twisted, blunted ruin overgrown with weeds and grass. The great atomic wars of the twentieth century had turned virtually the whole seaboard area into an endless waste of slag."," Slag and weeds below him. And then the sudden tangle that had been Central Park."," Histo-research came into sight. Reinhart swooped down, bringing his cruiser to rest at the small supply field behind the main buildings."," Harper, the chief official of the department, came quickly over as soon as Reinhart's ship landed."," \"Frankly, we don't understand why you consider this matter important,\" Harper said uneasily."," Reinhart shot him a cold glance. \"I'll be the judge of what's important. Are you the one who gave the order to bring the bubble back manually?\""," \"Fredman gave the actual order. In line with your directive to have all facilities ready for--\""," Reinhart headed toward the entrance of the research building. \"Where is Fredman?\""," \"Inside.\""," \"I want to see him. Let's go.\""," Fredman met them inside. He greeted Reinhart calmly, showing no emotion. \"Sorry to cause you trouble, Commissioner. We were trying to get the station in order for the war. We wanted the bubble back as quickly as possible.\" He eyed Reinhart curiously. \"No doubt the man and his cart will soon be picked up by your police.\""," \"I want to know everything that happened, in exact detail.\""," Fredman shifted uncomfortably. \"There's not much to tell. I gave the order to have the automatic setting canceled and the bubble brought back manually. At the moment the signal reached it, the bubble was passing through the spring of 1913. As it broke loose, it tore off a piece of ground on which this person and his cart were located. The person naturally was brought up to the present, inside the bubble.\""," \"Didn't any of your instruments tell you the bubble was loaded?\""," \"We were too excited to take any readings. Half an hour after the manual control was thrown, the bubble materialized in the observation room. It was de-energized before anyone noticed what was inside. We tried to stop him but he drove the cart out into the hall, bowling us out of the way. The horses were in a panic.\""," \"What kind of cart was it?\""," \"There was some kind of sign on it. Painted in black letters on both sides. No one saw what it was.\""," \"Go ahead. What happened then?\""," \"Somebody fired a Slem-ray after him, but it missed. The horses carried him out of the building and onto the grounds. By the time we reached the exit the cart was half way to the park.\""," Reinhart reflected. \"If he's still in the park we should have him shortly. But we must be careful.\" He was already starting back toward his ship, leaving Fredman behind. Harper fell in beside him."," Reinhart halted by his ship. He beckoned some Government guards over. \"Put the executive staff of this department under arrest. I'll have them tried on a treason count, later on.\" He smiled ironically as Harper's face blanched sickly pale. \"There's a war going on. You'll be lucky if you get off alive.\""," Reinhart entered his ship and left the surface, rising rapidly into the sky. A second ship followed after him, a military escort. Reinhart flew high above the sea of gray slag, the unrecovered waste area. He passed over a sudden square of green set in the ocean of gray. Reinhart gazed back at it until it was gone."," Central Park. He could see police ships racing through the sky, ships and transports loaded with troops, heading toward the square of green. On the ground some heavy guns and surface cars rumbled along, lines of black approaching the park from all sides."," They would have the man soon. But meanwhile, the SRB machines were blank. And on the SRB machines' readings the whole war depended."," About noon the cart reached the edge of the park. Cole rested for a moment, allowing the horses time to crop at the thick grass. The silent expanse of slag amazed him. What had happened? Nothing stirred. No buildings, no sign of life. Grass and weeds poked up occasionally through it, breaking the flat surface here and there, but even so, the sight gave him an uneasy chill."," Cole drove the cart slowly out onto the slag, studying the sky above him. There was nothing to hide him, now that he was out of the park. The slag was bare and uniform, like the ocean. If he were spotted--"," A horde of tiny black dots raced across the sky, coming rapidly closer. Presently they veered to the right and disappeared. More planes, wingless metal planes. He watched them go, driving slowly on."," Half an hour later something appeared ahead. Cole slowed the cart down, peering to see. The slag came to an end. He had reached its limits. Ground appeared, dark soil and grass. Weeds grew everywhere. Ahead of him, beyond the end of the slag, was a line of buildings, houses of some sort. Or sheds."," Houses, probably. But not like any he had ever seen."," The houses were uniform, all exactly the same. Like little green shells, rows of them, several hundred. There was a little lawn in front of each. Lawn, a path, a front porch, bushes in a meager row around each house. But the houses were all alike and very small."," Little green shells in precise, even rows. He urged the cart cautiously forward, toward the houses."," No one seemed to be around. He entered a street between two rows of houses, the hoofs of his two horses sounding loudly in the silence. He was in some kind of town. But there were no dogs or children. Everything was neat and silent. Like a model. An exhibit. It made him uncomfortable."," A young man walking along the pavement gaped at him in wonder. An oddly-dressed youth, in a toga-like cloak that hung down to his knees. A single piece of fabric. And sandals."," Or what looked like sandals. Both the cloak and the sandals were of some strange half-luminous material. It glowed faintly in the sunlight. Metallic, rather than cloth."," A woman was watering flowers at the edge of a lawn. She straightened up as his team of horses came near. Her eyes widened in astonishment--and then fear. Her mouth fell open in a soundless O and her sprinkling can slipped from her fingers and rolled silently onto the lawn."," Cole blushed and turned his head quickly away. The woman was scarcely dressed! He flicked the reins and urged the horses to hurry."," Behind him, the woman still stood. He stole a brief, hasty look back--and then shouted hoarsely to his team, ears scarlet. He had seen right. She wore only a pair of translucent shorts. Nothing else. A mere fragment of the same half-luminous material that glowed and sparkled. The rest of her small body was utterly naked."," He slowed the team down. She had been pretty. Brown hair and eyes, deep red lips. Quite a good figure. Slender waist, downy legs, bare and supple, full breasts--. He clamped the thought furiously off. He had to get to work. Business."," Cole halted the Fixit cart and leaped down onto the pavement. He selected a house at random and approached it cautiously. The house was attractive. It had a certain simple beauty. But it looked frail--and exactly like the others."," He stepped up on the porch. There was no bell. He searched for it, running his hand uneasily over the surface of the door. All at once there was a click, a sharp snap on a level with his eyes. Cole glanced up, startled. A lens was vanishing as the door section slid over it. He had been photographed."," While he was wondering what it meant, the door swung suddenly open. A man filled up the entrance, a big man in a tan uniform, blocking the way ominously."," \"What do you want?\" the man demanded."," \"I'm looking for work,\" Cole murmured. \"Any kind of work. I can do anything, fix any kind of thing. I repair broken objects. Things that need mending.\" His voice trailed off uncertainly. \"Anything at all.\""," \"Apply to the Placement Department of the Federal Activities Control Board,\" the man said crisply. \"You know all occupational therapy is handled through them.\" He eyed Cole curiously. \"Why have you got on those ancient clothes?\""," \"Ancient? Why, I--\""," The man gazed past him at the Fixit cart and the two dozing horses. \"What's that? What are those two animals? Horses?\" The man rubbed his jaw, studying Cole intently. \"That's strange,\" he said."," \"Strange?\" Cole murmured uneasily. \"Why?\""," \"There haven't been any horses for over a century. All the horses were wiped out during the Fifth Atomic War. That's why it's strange.\""," Cole tensed, suddenly alert. There was something in the man's eyes, a hardness, a piercing look. Cole moved back off the porch, onto the path. He had to be careful. Something was wrong."," \"I'll be going,\" he murmured."," \"There haven't been any horses for over a hundred years.\" The man came toward Cole. \"Who are you? Why are you dressed up like that? Where did you get that vehicle and pair of horses?\""," \"I'll be going,\" Cole repeated, moving away."," The man whipped something from his belt, a thin metal tube. He stuck it toward Cole."," It was a rolled-up paper, a thin sheet of metal in the form of a tube. Words, some kind of script. He could not make any of them out. The man's picture, rows of numbers, figures--"," \"I'm Director Winslow,\" the man said. \"Federal Stockpile Conservation. You better talk fast, or there'll be a Security car here in five minutes.\""," Cole moved--fast. He raced, head down, back along the path to the cart, toward the street."," Something hit him. A wall of force, throwing him down on his face. He sprawled in a heap, numb and dazed. His body ached, vibrating wildly, out of control. Waves of shock rolled over him, gradually diminishing."," He got shakily to his feet. His head spun. He was weak, shattered, trembling violently. The man was coming down the walk after him. Cole pulled himself onto the cart, gasping and retching. The horses jumped into life. Cole rolled over against the seat, sick with the motion of the swaying cart."," He caught hold of the reins and managed to drag himself up in a sitting position. The cart gained speed, turning a corner. Houses flew past. Cole urged the team weakly, drawing great shuddering breaths. Houses and streets, a blur of motion, as the cart flew faster and faster along."," Then he was leaving the town, leaving the neat little houses behind. He was on some sort of highway. Big buildings, factories, on both sides of the highway. Figures, men watching in astonishment."," After awhile the factories fell behind. Cole slowed the team down. What had the man meant? Fifth Atomic War. Horses destroyed. It didn't make sense. And they had things he knew nothing about. Force fields. Planes without wings--soundless."," Cole reached around in his pockets. He found the identification tube the man had handed him. In the excitement he had carried it off. He unrolled the tube slowly and began to study it. The writing was strange to him."," For a long time he studied the tube. Then, gradually, he became aware of something. Something in the top right-hand corner."," A date. October 6, 2128."," Cole's vision blurred. Everything spun and wavered around him. October, 2128. Could it be?"," But he held the paper in his hand. Thin, metal paper. Like foil. And it had to be. It said so, right in the corner, printed on the paper itself."," Cole rolled the tube up slowly, numbed with shock. Two hundred years. It didn't seem possible. But things were beginning to make sense. He was in the future, two hundred years in the future."," While he was mulling this over, the swift black Security ship appeared overhead, diving rapidly toward the horse-drawn cart, as it moved slowly along the road."," Reinhart's vidscreen buzzed. He snapped it quickly on. \"Yes?\""," \"Report from Security.\""," \"Put it through.\" Reinhart waited tensely as the lines locked in place. The screen re-lit."," \"This is Dixon. Western Regional Command.\" The officer cleared his throat, shuffling his message plates. \"The man from the past has been reported, moving away from the New York area.\""," \"Which side of your net?\""," \"Outside. He evaded the net around Central Park by entering one of the small towns at the rim of the slag area.\""," \"Evaded?\""," \"We assumed he would avoid the towns. Naturally the net failed to encompass any of the towns.\""," Reinhart's jaw stiffened. \"Go on.\""," \"He entered the town of Petersville a few minutes before the net closed around the park. We burned the park level, but naturally found nothing. He had already gone. An hour later we received a report from a resident in Petersville, an official of the Stockpile Conservation Department. The man from the past had come to his door, looking for work. Winslow, the official, engaged him in conversation, trying to hold onto him, but he escaped, driving his cart off. Winslow called Security right away, but by then it was too late.\""," \"Report to me as soon as anything more comes in. We must have him--and damn soon.\" Reinhart snapped the screen off. It died quickly."," He sat back in his chair, waiting."," Cole saw the shadow of the Security ship. He reacted at once. A second after the shadow passed over him, Cole was out of the cart, running and falling. He rolled, twisting and turning, pulling his body as far away from the cart as possible."," There was a blinding roar and flash of white light. A hot wind rolled over Cole, picking him up and tossing him like a leaf. He shut his eyes, letting his body relax. He bounced, falling and striking the ground. Gravel and stones tore into his face, his knees, the palms of his hands."," Cole cried out, shrieking in pain. His body was on fire. He was being consumed, incinerated by the blinding white orb of fire. The orb expanded, growing in size, swelling like some monstrous sun, twisted and bloated. The end had come. There was no hope. He gritted his teeth--"," The greedy orb faded, dying down. It sputtered and winked out, blackening into ash. The air reeked, a bitter acrid smell. His clothes were burning and smoking. The ground under him was hot, baked dry, seared by the blast. But he was alive. At least, for awhile."," Cole opened his eyes slowly. The cart was gone. A great hole gaped where it had been, a shattered sore in the center of the highway. An ugly cloud hung above the hole, black and ominous. Far above, the wingless plane circled, watching for any signs of life."," Cole lay, breathing shallowly, slowly. Time passed. The sun moved across the sky with agonizing slowness. It was perhaps four in the afternoon. Cole calculated mentally. In three hours it would be dark. If he could stay alive until then--"," Had the plane seen him leap from the cart?"," He lay without moving. The late afternoon sun beat down on him. He felt sick, nauseated and feverish. His mouth was dry."," Some ants ran over his outstretched hand. Gradually, the immense black cloud was beginning to drift away, dispersing into a formless blob."," The cart was gone. The thought lashed against him, pounding at his brain, mixing with his labored pulse-beat. Gone. Destroyed. Nothing but ashes and debris remained. The realization dazed him."," Finally the plane finished its circling, winging its way toward the horizon. At last it vanished. The sky was clear."," Cole got unsteadily to his feet. He wiped his face shakily. His body ached and trembled. He spat a couple times, trying to clear his mouth. The plane would probably send in a report. People would be coming to look for him. Where could he go?"," To his right a line of hills rose up, a distant green mass. Maybe he could reach them. He began to walk slowly. He had to be very careful. They were looking for him--and they had weapons. Incredible weapons."," He would be lucky to still be alive when the sun set. His team and Fixit cart were gone--and all his tools. Cole reached into his pockets, searching through them hopefully. He brought out some small screwdrivers, a little pair of cutting pliers, some wire, some solder, the whetstone, and finally the lady's knife."," Only a few small tools remained. He had lost everything else. But without the cart he was safer, harder to spot. They would have more trouble finding him, on foot."," Cole hurried along, crossing the level fields toward the distant range of hills."," The call came through to Reinhart almost at once. Dixon's features formed on the vidscreen. \"I have a further report, Commissioner.\" Dixon scanned the plate. \"Good news. The man from the past was sighted moving away from Petersville, along highway 13, at about ten miles an hour, on his horse-drawn cart. Our ship bombed him immediately.\""," \"Did--did you get him?\""," \"The pilot reports no sign of life after the blast.\""," Reinhart's pulse almost stopped. He sank back in his chair. \"Then he's dead!\""," \"Actually, we won't know for certain until we can examine the debris. A surface car is speeding toward the spot. We should have the complete report in a short time. We'll notify you as soon as the information comes in.\""," Reinhart reached out and cut the screen. It faded into darkness. Had they got the man from the past? Or had he escaped again? Weren't they ever going to get him? Couldn't he be captured? And meanwhile, the SRB machines were silent, showing nothing at all."," Reinhart sat brooding, waiting impatiently for the report of the surface car to come in."," *****"," It was evening."," \"Come on!\" Steven shouted, running frantically after his brother. \"Come on back!\""," \"Catch me.\" Earl ran and ran, down the side of the hill, over behind a military storage depot, along a neotex fence, jumping finally down into Mrs. Norris' back yard."," Steven hurried after his brother, sobbing for breath, shouting and gasping as he ran. \"Come back! You come back with that!\""," \"What's he got?\" Sally Tate demanded, stepping out suddenly to block Steven's way.","",""," Steven halted, his chest rising and falling. \"He's got my intersystem vidsender.\" His small face twisted with rage and misery. \"He better give it back!\""," Earl came circling around from the right. In the warm gloom of evening he was almost invisible. \"Here I am,\" he announced. \"What you going to do?\""," Steven glared at him hotly. His eyes made out the square box in Earl's hands. \"You give that back! Or--or I'll tell Dad.\""," Earl laughed. \"Make me.\""," \"Dad'll make you.\""," \"You better give it to him,\" Sally said."," \"Catch me.\" Earl started off. Steven pushed Sally out of the way, lashing wildly at his brother. He collided with him, throwing him sprawling. The box fell from Earl's hands. It skidded to the pavement, crashing into the side of a guide-light post."," Earl and Steven picked themselves up slowly. They gazed down at the broken box."," \"See?\" Steven shrilled, tears filling his eyes. \"See what you did?\""," \"You did it. You pushed into me.\""," \"You did it!\"' Steven bent down and picked up the box. He carried it over to the guide-light, sitting down on the curb to examine it."," Earl came slowly over. \"If you hadn't pushed me it wouldn't have got broken.\""," Night was descending rapidly. The line of hills rising above the town were already lost in darkness. A few lights had come on here and there. The evening was warm. A surface car slammed its doors, some place off in the distance. In the sky ships droned back and forth, weary commuters coming home from work in the big underground factory units."," Thomas Cole came slowly toward the three children grouped around the guide-light. He moved with difficulty, his body sore and bent with fatigue. Night had come, but he was not safe yet."," He was tired, exhausted and hungry. He had walked a long way. And he had to have something to eat--soon."," A few feet from the children Cole stopped. They were all intent and absorbed by the box on Steven's knees. Suddenly a hush fell over the children. Earl looked up slowly."," In the dim light the big stooped figure of Thomas Cole seemed extra menacing. His long arms hung down loosely at his sides. His face was lost in shadow. His body was shapeless, indistinct. A big unformed statue, standing silently a few feet away, unmoving in the half-darkness."," \"Who are you?\" Earl demanded, his voice low."," \"What do you want?\" Sally said. The children edged away nervously. \"Get away.\""," Cole came toward them. He bent down a little. The beam from the guide-light crossed his features. Lean, prominent nose, beak-like, faded blue eyes--"," Steven scrambled to his feet, clutching the vidsender box. \"You get out of here!\""," \"Wait.\" Cole smiled crookedly at them. His voice was dry and raspy. \"What do you have there?\" He pointed with his long, slender fingers. \"The box you're holding.\""," The children were silent. Finally Steven stirred. \"It's my inter-system vidsender.\""," \"Only it doesn't work,\" Sally said."," \"Earl broke it.\" Steven glared at his brother bitterly. \"Earl threw it down and broke it.\""," Cole smiled a little. He sank down wearily on the edge of the curb, sighing with relief. He had been walking too long. His body ached with fatigue. He was hungry, and tired. For a long time he sat, wiping perspiration from his neck and face, too exhausted to speak."," \"Who are you?\" Sally demanded, at last. \"Why do you have on those funny clothes? Where did you come from?\""," \"Where?\" Cole looked around at the children. \"From a long way off. A long way.\" He shook his head slowly from side to side, trying to clear it."," \"What's your therapy?\" Earl said."," \"My therapy?\""," \"What do you do? Where do you work?\""," Cole took a deep breath and let it out again slowly. \"I fix things. All kinds of things. Any kind.\""," Earl sneered. \"Nobody fixes things. When they break you throw them away.\""," Cole didn't hear him. Sudden need had roused him, getting him suddenly to his feet. \"You know any work I can find?\" he demanded. \"Things I could do? I can fix anything. Clocks, type-writers, refrigerators, pots and pans. Leaks in the roof. I can fix anything there is.\""," Steven held out his inter-system vidsender. \"Fix this.\""," There was silence. Slowly, Cole's eyes focussed on the box. \"That?\""," \"My sender. Earl broke it.\""," Cole took the box slowly. He turned it over, holding it up to the light. He frowned, concentrating on it. His long, slender fingers moved carefully over the surface, exploring it."," \"He'll steal it!\" Earl said suddenly."," \"No.\" Cole shook his head vaguely. \"I'm reliable.\" His sensitive fingers found the studs that held the box together. He depressed the studs, pushing them expertly in. The box opened, revealing its complex interior."," \"He got it open,\" Sally whispered."," \"Give it back!\" Steven demanded, a little frightened. He held out his hand. \"I want it back.\""," The three children watched Cole apprehensively. Cole fumbled in his pocket. Slowly he brought out his tiny screwdrivers and pliers. He laid them in a row beside him. He made no move to return the box."," \"I want it back,\" Steven said feebly."," Cole looked up. His faded blue eyes took in the sight of the three children standing before him in the gloom. \"I'll fix it for you. You said you wanted it fixed.\""," \"I want it back.\" Steven stood on one foot, then the other, torn by doubt and indecision. \"Can you really fix it? Can you make it work again?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"All right. Fix it for me, then.\""," A sly smile flickered across Cole's tired face. \"Now, wait a minute. If I fix it, will you bring me something to eat? I'm not fixing it for nothing.\""," \"Something to eat?\""," \"Food. I need hot food. Maybe some coffee.\""," Steven nodded. \"Yes. I'll get it for you.\""," Cole relaxed. \"Fine. That's fine.\" He turned his attention back to the box resting between his knees. \"Then I'll fix it for you. I'll fix it for you good.\""," His fingers flew, working and twisting, tracing down wires and relays, exploring and examining. Finding out about the inter-system vidsender. Discovering how it worked."," Steven slipped into the house through the emergency door. He made his way to the kitchen with great care, walking on tip-toe. He punched the kitchen controls at random, his heart beating excitedly. The stove began to whirr, purring into life. Meter readings came on, crossing toward the completion marks."," Presently the stove opened, sliding out a tray of steaming dishes. The mechanism clicked off, dying into silence. Steven grabbed up the contents of the tray, filling his arms. He carried everything down the hall, out the emergency door and into the yard. The yard was dark. Steven felt his way carefully along."," He managed to reach the guide-light without dropping anything at all."," Thomas Cole got slowly to his feet as Steven came into view. \"Here,\" Steven said. He dumped the food onto the curb, gasping for breath. \"Here's the food. Is it finished?\""," Cole held out the inter-system vidsender. \"It's finished. It was pretty badly smashed.\""," Earl and Sally gazed up, wide-eyed. \"Does it work?\" Sally asked."," \"Of course not,\" Earl stated. \"How could it work? He couldn't--\""," \"Turn it on!\" Sally nudged Steven eagerly. \"See if it works.\""," Steven was holding the box under the light, examining the switches. He clicked the main switch on. The indicator light gleamed. \"It lights up,\" Steven said."," \"Say something into it.\""," Steven spoke into the box. \"Hello! Hello! This is operator 6-Z75 calling. Can you hear me? This is operator 6-Z75. Can you hear me?\""," In the darkness, away from the beam of the guide-light, Thomas Cole sat crouched over the food. He ate gratefully, silently. It was good food, well cooked and seasoned. He drank a container of orange juice and then a sweet drink he didn't recognize. Most of the food was strange to him, but he didn't care. He had walked a long way and he was plenty hungry. And he still had a long way to go, before morning. He had to be deep in the hills before the sun came up. Instinct told him that he would be safe among the trees and tangled growth--at least, as safe as he could hope for."," He ate rapidly, intent on the food. He did not look up until he was finished. Then he got slowly to his feet, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand."," The three children were standing around in a circle, operating the inter-system vidsender. He watched them for a few minutes. None of them looked up from the small box. They were intent, absorbed in what they were doing."," \"Well?\" Cole said, at last. \"Does it work all right?\""," After a moment Steven looked up at him. There was a strange expression on his face. He nodded slowly. \"Yes. Yes, it works. It works fine.\""," Cole grunted. \"All right.\" He turned and moved away from the light. \"That's fine.\""," The children watched silently until the figure of Thomas Cole had completely disappeared. Slowly, they turned and looked at each other. Then down at the box in Steven's hands. They gazed at the box in growing awe. Awe mixed with dawning fear."," Steven turned and edged toward his house. \"I've got to show it to my Dad,\" he murmured, dazed. \"He's got to know. Somebody's got to know!\"","",""," III","",""," \"Then he did escape from the blast,\" Dixon admitted reluctantly. \"He must have leaped from the cart just before the concussion.\""," Reinhart nodded. \"He escaped. He got away from you--twice.\" He pushed the vidsender box away and leaned abruptly toward the man standing uneasily in front of his desk. \"What's your name again?\""," \"Elliot. Richard Elliot.\""," \"And your son's name?\""," \"Steven.\""," \"It was last night this happened?\""," \"About eight o'clock.\""," \"Go on.\""," \"Steven came into the house. He acted queerly. He was carrying his inter-system vidsender.\" Elliot pointed at the box on Reinhart's desk. \"That. He was nervous and excited. I asked what was wrong. For awhile he couldn't tell me. He was quite upset. Then he showed me the vidsender.\" Elliot took a deep, shaky breath. \"I could see right away it was different. You see I'm an electrical engineer. I had opened it once before, to put in a new battery. I had a fairly good idea how it should look.\" Elliot hesitated. \"Commissioner, it had been changed. A lot of the wiring was different. Moved around. Relays connected differently. Some parts were missing. New parts had been jury rigged out of old. Then I discovered the thing that made me call Security. The vidsender--it really worked.\""," \"Worked?\""," \"You see, it never was anything more than a toy. With a range of a few city blocks. So the kids could call back and forth from their rooms. Like a sort of portable vidscreen. Commissioner, I tried out the vidsender, pushing the call button and speaking into the microphone. I--I got a ship of the line. A battleship, operating beyond Proxima Centaurus--over eight light years away. As far out as the actual vidsenders operate. Then I called Security. Right away.\""," For a time Reinhart was silent. Finally he tapped the box lying on the desk. \"You got a ship of the line--with this?\""," \"That's right.\""," \"How big are the regular vidsenders?\""," Dixon supplied the information. \"As big as a twenty-ton safe.\""," \"That's what I thought.\" Reinhart waved his hand impatiently. \"All right, Elliot. Thanks for turning the information over to us. That's all.\""," Security police led Elliot outside the office."," Reinhart and Dixon looked at each other. \"This is bad,\" Reinhart said harshly. \"He has some ability, some kind of mechanical ability. Genius, perhaps, to do a thing like this. Look at the period he came from, Dixon. The early part of the twentieth century. Before the wars began. That was a unique period. There was a certain vitality, a certain ability. It was a period of incredible growth and discovery. Edison. Pasteur. Burbank. The Wright brothers. Inventions and machines. People had an uncanny ability with machines. A kind of intuition about machines--which we don't have.\""," \"You mean--\""," \"I mean a person like this coming into our own time is bad in itself, war or no war. He's too different. He's oriented along different lines. He has abilities we lack. This fixing skill of his. It throws us off, out of kilter. And with the war...."," \"Now I'm beginning to understand why the SRB machines couldn't factor him. It's impossible for us to understand this kind of person. Winslow says he asked for work, any kind of work. The man said he could do anything, fix anything. Do you understand what that means?\""," \"No,\" Dixon said. \"What does it mean?\""," \"Can any of us fix anything? No. None of us can do that. We're specialized. Each of us has his own line, his own work. I understand my work, you understand yours. The tendency in evolution is toward greater and greater specialization. Man's society is an ecology that forces adaptation to it. Continual complexity makes it impossible for any of us to know anything outside our own personal field--I can't follow the work of the man sitting at the next desk over from me. Too much knowledge has piled up in each field. And there's too many fields."," \"This man is different. He can fix anything, do anything. He doesn't work with knowledge, with science--the classified accumulation of facts. He knows nothing. It's not in his head, a form of learning. He works by intuition--his power is in his hands, not his head. Jack-of-all-trades. His hands! Like a painter, an artist. In his hands--and he cuts across our lives like a knife-blade.\""," \"And the other problem?\""," \"The other problem is that this man, this variable man, has escaped into the Albertine Mountain range. Now we'll have one hell of a time finding him. He's clever--in a strange kind of way. Like some sort of animal. He's going to be hard to catch.\""," Reinhart sent Dixon out. After a moment he gathered up the handful of reports on his desk and carried them up to the SRB room. The SRB room was closed up, sealed off by a ring of armed Security police. Standing angrily before the ring of police was Peter Sherikov, his beard waggling angrily, his immense hands on his hips."," \"What's going on?\" Sherikov demanded. \"Why can't I go in and peep at the odds?\""," \"Sorry.\" Reinhart cleared the police aside. \"Come inside with me. I'll explain.\" The doors opened for them and they entered. Behind them the doors shut and the ring of police formed outside. \"What brings you away from your lab?\" Reinhart asked."," Sherikov shrugged. \"Several things. I wanted to see you. I called you on the vidphone and they said you weren't available. I thought maybe something had happened. What's up?\""," \"I'll tell you in a few minutes.\" Reinhart called Kaplan over. \"Here are some new items. Feed them in right away. I want to see if the machines can total them.\""," \"Certainly, Commissioner.\" Kaplan took the message plates and placed them on an intake belt. The machines hummed into life."," \"We'll know soon,\" Reinhart said, half aloud."," Sherikov shot him a keen glance. \"We'll know what? Let me in on it. What's taking place?\""," \"We're in trouble. For twenty-four hours the machines haven't given any reading at all. Nothing but a blank. A total blank.\""," Sherikov's features registered disbelief. \"But that isn't possible. Some odds exist at all times.\""," \"The odds exist, but the machines aren't able to calculate them.\""," \"Why not?\""," \"Because a variable factor has been introduced. A factor which the machines can't handle. They can't make any predictions from it.\""," \"Can't they reject it?\" Sherikov said slyly. \"Can't they just--just ignore it?\""," \"No. It exists, as real data. Therefore it affects the balance of the material, the sum total of all other available data. To reject it would be to give a false reading. The machines can't reject any data that's known to be true.\""," Sherikov pulled moodily at his black beard. \"I would be interested in knowing what sort of factor the machines can't handle. I thought they could take in all data pertaining to contemporary reality.\""," \"They can. This factor has nothing to do with contemporary reality. That's the trouble. Histo-research in bringing its time bubble back from the past got overzealous and cut the circuit too quickly. The bubble came back loaded--with a man from the twentieth century. A man from the past.\""," \"I see. A man from two centuries ago.\" The big Pole frowned. \"And with a radically different Weltanschauung. No connection with our present society. Not integrated along our lines at all. Therefore the SRB machines are perplexed.\""," Reinhart grinned. \"Perplexed? I suppose so. In any case, they can't do anything with the data about this man. The variable man. No statistics at all have been thrown up--no predictions have been made. And it knocks everything else out of phase. We're dependent on the constant showing of these odds. The whole war effort is geared around them.\""," \"The horse-shoe nail. Remember the old poem? 'For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of the shoe the horse was lost. For want of the horse the rider was lost. For want--'\""," \"Exactly. A single factor coming along like this, one single individual, can throw everything off. It doesn't seem possible that one person could knock an entire society out of balance--but apparently it is.\""," \"What are you doing about this man?\""," \"The Security police are organized in a mass search for him.\""," \"Results?\""," \"He escaped into the Albertine Mountain Range last night. It'll be hard to find him. We must expect him to be loose for another forty-eight hours. It'll take that long for us to arrange the annihilation of the range area. Perhaps a trifle longer. And meanwhile--\""," \"Ready, Commissioner,\" Kaplan interrupted. \"The new totals.\""," The SRB machines had finished factoring the new data. Reinhart and Sherikov hurried to take their places before the view windows."," For a moment nothing happened. Then odds were put up, locking in place."," Sherikov gasped. 99-2. In favor of Terra. \"That's wonderful! Now we--\""," The odds vanished. New odds took their places. 97-4. In favor of Centaurus. Sherikov groaned in astonished dismay. \"Wait,\" Reinhart said to him. \"I don't think they'll last.\""," The odds vanished. A rapid series of odds shot across the screen, a violent stream of numbers, changing almost instantly. At last the machines became silent."," Nothing showed. No odds. No totals at all. The view windows were blank."," \"You see?\" Reinhart murmured. \"The same damn thing!\""," Sherikov pondered. \"Reinhart, you're too Anglo-Saxon, too impulsive. Be more Slavic. This man will be captured and destroyed within two days. You said so yourself. Meanwhile, we're all working night and day on the war effort. The warfleet is waiting near Proxima, taking up positions for the attack on the Centaurans. All our war plants are going full blast. By the time the attack date comes we'll have a full-sized invasion army ready to take off for the long trip to the Centauran colonies. The whole Terran population has been mobilized. The eight supply planets are pouring in material. All this is going on day and night, even without odds showing. Long before the attack comes this man will certainly be dead, and the machines will be able to show odds again.\""," Reinhart considered. \"But it worries me, a man like that out in the open. Loose. A man who can't be predicted. It goes against science. We've been making statistical reports on society for two centuries. We have immense files of data. The machines are able to predict what each person and group will do at a given time, in a given situation. But this man is beyond all prediction. He's a variable. It's contrary to science.\""," \"The indeterminate particle.\""," \"What's that?\""," \"The particle that moves in such a way that we can't predict what position it will occupy at a given second. Random. The random particle.\""," \"Exactly. It's--it's unnatural.\""," Sherikov laughed sarcastically. \"Don't worry about it, Commissioner. The man will be captured and things will return to their natural state. You'll be able to predict people again, like laboratory rats in a maze. By the way--why is this room guarded?\""," \"I don't want anyone to know the machines show no totals. It's dangerous to the war effort.\""," \"Margaret Duffe, for example?\""," Reinhart nodded reluctantly. \"They're too timid, these parliamentarians. If they discover we have no SRB odds they'll want to shut down the war planning and go back to waiting.\""," \"Too slow for you, Commissioner? Laws, debates, council meetings, discussions.... Saves a lot of time if one man has all the power. One man to tell people what to do, think for them, lead them around.\""," Reinhart eyed the big Pole critically. \"That reminds me. How is Icarus coming? Have you continued to make progress on the control turret?\""," A scowl crossed Sherikov's broad features. \"The control turret?\" He waved his big hand vaguely. \"I would say it's coming along all right. We'll catch up in time.\""," Instantly Reinhart became alert. \"Catch up? You mean you're still behind?\""," \"Somewhat. A little. But we'll catch up.\" Sherikov retreated toward the door. \"Let's go down to the cafeteria and have a cup of coffee. You worry too much, Commissioner. Take things more in your stride.\""," \"I suppose you're right.\" The two men walked out into the hall. \"I'm on edge. This variable man. I can't get him out of my mind.\""," \"Has he done anything yet?\""," \"Nothing important. Rewired a child's toy. A toy vidsender.\""," \"Oh?\" Sherikov showed interest. \"What do you mean? What did he do?\""," \"I'll show you.\" Reinhart led Sherikov down the hall to his office. They entered and Reinhart locked the door. He handed Sherikov the toy and roughed in what Cole had done. A strange look crossed Sherikov's face. He found the studs on the box and depressed them. The box opened. The big Pole sat down at the desk and began to study the interior of the box. \"You're sure it was the man from the past who rewired this?\""," \"Of course. On the spot. The boy damaged it playing. The variable man came along and the boy asked him to fix it. He fixed it, all right.\""," \"Incredible.\" Sherikov's eyes were only an inch from the wiring. \"Such tiny relays. How could he--\""," \"What?\""," \"Nothing.\" Sherikov got abruptly to his feet, closing the box carefully. \"Can I take this along? To my lab? I'd like to analyze it more fully.\""," \"Of course. But why?\""," \"No special reason. Let's go get our coffee.\" Sherikov headed toward the door. \"You say you expect to capture this man in a day or so?\""," \"Kill him, not capture him. We've got to eliminate him as a piece of data. We're assembling the attack formations right now. No slip-ups, this time. We're in the process of setting up a cross-bombing pattern to level the entire Albertine range. He must be destroyed, within the next forty-eight hours.\""," Sherikov nodded absently. \"Of course,\" he murmured. A preoccupied expression still remained on his broad features. \"I understand perfectly.\""," *****"," Thomas Cole crouched over the fire he had built, warming his hands. It was almost morning. The sky was turning violet gray. The mountain air was crisp and chill. Cole shivered and pulled himself closer to the fire."," The heat felt good against his hands. His hands. He gazed down at them, glowing yellow-red in the firelight. The nails were black and chipped. Warts and endless calluses on each finger, and the palms. But they were good hands; the fingers were long and tapered. He respected them, although in some ways he didn't understand them."," Cole was deep in thought, meditating over his situation. He had been in the mountains two nights and a day. The first night had been the worst. Stumbling and falling, making his way uncertainly up the steep slopes, through the tangled brush and undergrowth--"," But when the sun came up he was safe, deep in the mountains, between two great peaks. And by the time the sun had set again he had fixed himself up a shelter and a means of making a fire. Now he had a neat little box trap, operated by a plaited grass rope and pit, a notched stake. One rabbit already hung by his hind legs and the trap was waiting for another."," The sky turned from violet gray to a deep cold gray, a metallic color. The mountains were silent and empty. Far off some place a bird sang, its voice echoing across the vast slopes and ravines. Other birds began to sing. Off to his right something crashed through the brush, an animal pushing its way along."," Day was coming. His second day. Cole got to his feet and began to unfasten the rabbit. Time to eat. And then? After that he had no plans. He knew instinctively that he could keep himself alive indefinitely with the tools he had retained, and the genius of his hands. He could kill game and skin it. Eventually he could build himself a permanent shelter, even make clothes but of hides. In winter--"," But he was not thinking that far ahead. Cole stood by the fire, staring up at the sky, his hands on his hips. He squinted, suddenly tense. Something was moving. Something in the sky, drifting slowly through the grayness. A black dot."," He stamped out the fire quickly. What was it? He strained, trying to see. A bird?"," A second dot joined the first. Two dots. Then three. Four. Five. A fleet of them, moving rapidly across the early morning sky. Toward the mountains."," Toward him."," Cole hurried away from the fire. He snatched up the rabbit and carried it along with him, into the tangled shelter he had built. He was invisible, inside the shelter. No one could find him. But if they had seen the fire--"," He crouched in the shelter, watching the dots grow larger. They were planes, all right. Black wingless planes, coming closer each moment. Now he could hear them, a faint dull buzz, increasing until the ground shook under him."," The first plane dived. It dropped like a stone, swelling into a great black shape. Cole gasped, sinking down. The plane roared in an arc, swooping low over the ground. Suddenly bundles tumbled out, white bundles falling and scattering like seeds."," The bundles drifted rapidly to the ground. They landed. They were men. Men in uniform."," Now the second plane was diving. It roared overhead, releasing its load. More bundles tumbled out, filling the sky. The third plane dived, then the fourth. The air was thick with drifting bundles of white, a blanket of descending weed spores, settling to earth."," On the ground the soldiers were forming into groups. Their shouts carried to Cole, crouched in his shelter. Fear leaped through him. They were landing on all sides of him. He was cut off. The last two planes had dropped men behind him."," He got to his feet, pushing out of the shelter. Some of the soldiers had found the fire, the ashes and coals. One dropped down, feeling the coals with his hand. He waved to the others. They were circling all around, shouting and gesturing. One of them began to set up some kind of gun. Others were unrolling coils of tubing, locking a collection of strange pipes and machinery in place."," Cole ran. He rolled down a slope, sliding and falling. At the bottom he leaped to his feet and plunged into the brush. Vines and leaves tore at his face, slashing and cutting him. He fell again, tangled in a mass of twisted shrubbery. He fought desperately, trying to free himself. If he could reach the knife in his pocket--"," Voices. Footsteps. Men were behind him, running down the slope. Cole struggled frantically, gasping and twisting, trying to pull loose. He strained, breaking the vines, clawing at them with his hands."," A soldier dropped to his knee, leveling his gun. More soldiers arrived, bringing up their rifles and aiming."," Cole cried out. He closed his eyes, his body suddenly limp. He waited, his teeth locked together, sweat dripping down his neck, into his shirt, sagging against the mesh of vines and branches coiled around him."," Silence."," Cole opened his eyes slowly. The soldiers had regrouped. A huge man was striding down the slope toward them, barking orders as he came."," Two soldiers stepped into the brush. One of them grabbed Cole by the shoulder."," \"Don't let go of him.\" The huge man came over, his black beard jutting out. \"Hold on.\""," Cole gasped for breath. He was caught. There was nothing he could do. More soldiers were pouring down into the gulley, surrounding him on all sides. They studied him curiously, murmuring together. Cole shook his head wearily and said nothing."," The huge man with the beard stood directly in front of him, his hands on his hips, looking him up and down. \"Don't try to get away,\" the man said. \"You can't get away. Do you understand?\""," Cole nodded."," \"All right. Good.\" The man waved. Soldiers clamped metal bands around Cole's arms and wrists. The metal dug into his flesh, making him gasp with pain. More clamps locked around his legs. \"Those stay there until we're out of here. A long way out.\""," \"Where--where are you taking me?\""," Peter Sherikov studied the variable man for a moment before he answered. \"Where? I'm taking you to my labs. Under the Urals.\" He glanced suddenly up at the sky. \"We better hurry. The Security police will be starting their demolition attack in a few hours. We want to be a long way from here when that begins.\""," *****"," Sherikov settled down in his comfortable reinforced chair with a sigh. \"It's good to be back.\" He signalled to one of his guards. \"All right. You can unfasten him.\""," The metal clamps were removed from Cole's arms and legs. He sagged, sinking down in a heap. Sherikov watched him silently."," Cole sat on the floor, rubbing his wrists and legs, saying nothing."," \"What do you want?\" Sherikov demanded. \"Food? Are you hungry?\""," \"No.\""," \"Medicine? Are you sick? Injured?\""," \"No.\""," Sherikov wrinkled his nose. \"A bath wouldn't hurt you any. We'll arrange that later.\" He lit a cigar, blowing a cloud of gray smoke around him. At the door of the room two lab guards stood with guns ready. No one else was in the room beside Sherikov and Cole."," Thomas Cole sat huddled in a heap on the floor, his head sunk down against his chest. He did not stir. His bent body seemed more elongated and stooped than ever, his hair tousled and unkempt, his chin and jowls a rough stubbled gray. His clothes were dirty and torn from crawling through the brush. His skin was cut and scratched; open sores dotted his neck and cheeks and forehead. He said nothing. His chest rose and fell. His faded blue eyes were almost closed. He looked quite old, a withered, dried-up old man."," Sherikov waved one of the guards over. \"Have a doctor brought up here. I want this man checked over. He may need intravenous injections. He may not have had anything to eat for awhile.\""," The guard departed."," \"I don't want anything to happen to you,\" Sherikov said. \"Before we go on I'll have you checked over. And deloused at the same time.\""," Cole said nothing."," Sherikov laughed. \"Buck up! You have no reason to feel bad.\" He leaned toward Cole, jabbing an immense finger at him. \"Another two hours and you'd have been dead, out there in the mountains. You know that?\""," Cole nodded."," \"You don't believe me. Look.\" Sherikov leaned over and snapped on the vidscreen mounted in the wall. \"Watch, this. The operation should still be going on.\""," The screen lit up. A scene gained form."," \"This is a confidential Security channel. I had it tapped several years ago--for my own protection. What we're seeing now is being piped in to Eric Reinhart.\" Sherikov grinned. \"Reinhart arranged what you're seeing on the screen. Pay close attention. You were there, two hours ago.\""," Cole turned toward the screen. At first he could not make out what was happening. The screen showed a vast foaming cloud, a vortex of motion. From the speaker came a low rumble, a deep-throated roar. After a time the screen shifted, showing a slightly different view. Suddenly Cole stiffened."," He was seeing the destruction of a whole mountain range."," The picture was coming from a ship, flying above what had once been the Albertine Mountain Range. Now there was nothing but swirling clouds of gray and columns of particles and debris, a surging tide of restless material gradually sweeping off and dissipating in all directions."," The Albertine Mountains had been disintegrated. Nothing remained but these vast clouds of debris. Below, on the ground, a ragged plain stretched out, swept by fire and ruin. Gaping wounds yawned, immense holes without bottom, craters side by side as far as the eye could see. Craters and debris. Like the blasted, pitted surface of the moon. Two hours ago it had been rolling peaks and gulleys, brush and green bushes and trees."," Cole turned away."," \"You see?\" Sherikov snapped the screen off. \"You were down there, not so long ago. All that noise and smoke--all for you. All for you, Mr. Variable Man from the past. Reinhart arranged that, to finish you off. I want you to understand that. It's very important that you realize that.\""," Cole said nothing."," Sherikov reached into a drawer of the table before him. He carefully brought out a small square box and held it out to Cole. \"You wired this, didn't you?\""," Cole took the box in his hands and held it. For a time his tired mind failed to focus. What did he have? He concentrated on it. The box was the children's toy. The inter-system vidsender, they had called it."," \"Yes. I fixed this.\" He passed it back to Sherikov. \"I repaired that. It was broken.\""," Sherikov gazed down at him intently, his large eyes bright. He nodded, his black beard and cigar rising and falling. \"Good. That's all I wanted to know.\" He got suddenly to his feet, pushing his chair back. \"I see the doctor's here. He'll fix you up. Everything you need. Later on I'll talk to you again.\""," Unprotesting, Cole got to his feet, allowing the doctor to take hold of his arm and help him up."," After Cole had been released by the medical department, Sherikov joined him in his private dining room, a floor above the actual laboratory."," The Pole gulped down a hasty meal, talking as he ate. Cole sat silently across from him, not eating or speaking. His old clothing had been taken away and new clothing given him. He was shaved and rubbed down. His sores and cuts were healed, his body and hair washed. He looked much healthier and younger, now. But he was still stooped and tired, his blue eyes worn and faded. He listened to Sherikov's account of the world of 2136 AD without comment."," \"You can see,\" Sherikov said finally, waving a chicken leg, \"that your appearance here has been very upsetting to our program. Now that you know more about us you can see why Commissioner Reinhart was so interested in destroying you.\""," Cole nodded."," \"Reinhart, you realize, believes that the failure of the SRB machines is the chief danger to the war effort. But that is nothing!\" Sherikov pushed his plate away noisily, draining his coffee mug. \"After all, wars can be fought without statistical forecasts. The SRB machines only describe. They're nothing more than mechanical onlookers. In themselves, they don't affect the course of the war. We make the war. They only analyze.\""," Cole nodded."," \"More coffee?\" Sherikov asked. He pushed the plastic container toward Cole. \"Have some.\""," Cole accepted another cupful. \"Thank you.\""," \"You can see that our real problem is another thing entirely. The machines only do figuring for us in a few minutes that eventually we could do for our own selves. They're our servants, tools. Not some sort of gods in a temple which we go and pray to. Not oracles who can see into the future for us. They don't see into the future. They only make statistical predictions--not prophecies. There's a big difference there, but Reinhart doesn't understand it. Reinhart and his kind have made such things as the SRB machines into gods. But I have no gods. At least, not any I can see.\""," Cole nodded, sipping his coffee."," \"I'm telling you all these things because you must understand what we're up against. Terra is hemmed in on all sides by the ancient Centauran Empire. It's been out there for centuries, thousands of years. No one knows how long. It's old--crumbling and rotting. Corrupt and venal. But it holds most of the galaxy around us, and we can't break out of the Sol system. I told you about Icarus, and Hedge's work in ftl flight. We must win the war against Centaurus. We've waited and worked a long time for this, the moment when we can break out and get room among the stars for ourselves. Icarus is the deciding weapon. The data on Icarus tipped the SRB odds in our favor--for the first time in history. Success in the war against Centaurus will depend on Icarus, not on the SRB machines. You see?\""," Cole nodded."," \"However, there is a problem. The data on Icarus which I turned over to the machines specified that Icarus would be completed in ten days. More than half that time has already passed. Yet, we are no closer to wiring up the control turret than we were then. The turret baffles us.\" Sherikov grinned ironically. \"Even I have tried my hand at the wiring, but with no success. It's intricate--and small. Too many technical bugs not worked out. We are building only one, you understand. If we had many experimental models worked out before--\""," \"But this is the experimental model,\" Cole said."," \"And built from the designs of a man dead four years--who isn't here to correct us. We've made Icarus with our own hands, down here in the labs. And he's giving us plenty of trouble.\" All at once Sherikov got to his feet. \"Let's go down to the lab and look at him.\""," They descended to the floor below, Sherikov leading the way. Cole stopped short at the lab door."," \"Quite a sight,\" Sherikov agreed. \"We keep him down here at the bottom for safety's sake. He's well protected. Come on in. We have work to do.\""," In the center of the lab Icarus rose up, the gray squat cylinder that someday would flash through space at a speed of thousands of times that of light, toward the heart of Proxima Centaurus, over four light years away. Around the cylinder groups of men in uniform were laboring feverishly to finish the remaining work."," \"Over here. The turret.\" Sherikov led Cole over to one side of the room. \"It's guarded. Centauran spies are swarming everywhere on Terra. They see into everything. But so do we. That's how we get information for the SRB machines. Spies in both systems.\""," The translucent globe that was the control turret reposed in the center of a metal stand, an armed guard standing at each side. They lowered their guns as Sherikov approached."," \"We don't want anything to happen to this,\" Sherikov said. \"Everything depends on it.\" He put out his hand for the globe. Half way to it his hand stopped, striking against an invisible presence in the air."," Sherikov laughed. \"The wall. Shut it off. It's still on.\""," One of the guards pressed a stud at his wrist. Around the globe the air shimmered and faded."," \"Now.\" Sherikov's hand closed over the globe. He lifted it carefully from its mount and brought it out for Cole to see. \"This is the control turret for our enormous friend here. This is what will slow him down when he's inside Centaurus. He slows down and re-enters this universe. Right in the heart of the star. Then--no more Centaurus.\" Sherikov beamed. \"And no more Armun.\""," But Cole was not listening. He had taken the globe from Sherikov and was turning it over and over, running his hands over it, his face close to its surface. He peered down into its interior, his face rapt and intent."," \"You can't see the wiring. Not without lenses.\" Sherikov signalled for a pair of micro-lenses to be brought. He fitted them on Cole's nose, hooking them behind his ears. \"Now try it. You can control the magnification. It's set for 1000X right now. You can increase or decrease it.\""," Cole gasped, swaying back and forth. Sherikov caught hold of him. Cole gazed down into the globe, moving his head slightly, focussing the glasses."," \"It takes practice. But you can do a lot with them. Permits you to do microscopic wiring. There are tools to go along, you understand.\" Sherikov paused, licking his lip. \"We can't get it done correctly. Only a few men can wire circuits using the micro-lenses and the little tools. We've tried robots, but there are too many decisions to be made. Robots can't make decisions. They just react.\""," Cole said nothing. He continued to gaze into the interior of the globe, his lips tight, his body taut and rigid. It made Sherikov feel strangely uneasy."," \"You look like one of those old fortune tellers,\" Sherikov said jokingly, but a cold shiver crawled up his spine. \"Better hand it back to me.\" He held out his hand."," Slowly, Cole returned the globe. After a time he removed the micro-lenses, still deep in thought."," \"Well?\" Sherikov demanded. \"You know what I want. I want you to wire this damn thing up.\" Sherikov came close to Cole, his big face hard. \"You can do it, I think. I could tell by the way you held it--and the job you did on the children's toy, of course. You could wire it up right, and in five days. Nobody else can. And if it's not wired up Centaurus will keep on running the galaxy and Terra will have to sweat it out here in the Sol system. One tiny mediocre sun, one dust mote out of a whole galaxy.\""," Cole did not answer."," Sherikov became impatient. \"Well? What do you say?\""," \"What happens if I don't wire this control for you? I mean, what happens to me?\""," \"Then I turn you over to Reinhart. Reinhart will kill you instantly. He thinks you're dead, killed when the Albertine Range was annihilated. If he had any idea I had saved you--\""," \"I see.\""," \"I brought you down here for one thing. If you wire it up I'll have you sent back to your own time continuum. If you don't--\""," Cole considered, his face dark and brooding."," \"What do you have to lose? You'd already be dead, if we hadn't pulled you out of those hills.\""," \"Can you really return me to my own time?\""," \"Of course!\""," \"Reinhart won't interfere?\""," Sherikov laughed. \"What can he do? How can he stop me? I have my own men. You saw them. They landed all around you. You'll be returned.\""," \"Yes. I saw your men.\""," \"Then you agree?\""," \"I agree,\" Thomas Cole said. \"I'll wire it for you. I'll complete the control turret--within the next five days.\"","",""," IV","",""," \"Here. You might be interested in this.\""," Reinhart picked the plate up slowly. \"What is it? You came all the way here to show me this?\""," \"That's right.\""," \"Why didn't you vidscreen it?\""," Dixon smiled grimly. \"You'll understand when you decode it. It's from Proxima Centaurus.\""," \"Centaurus!\""," \"Our counter-intelligence service. They sent it direct to me. Here, I'll decode it for you. Save you the trouble.\""," Dixon came around behind Reinhart's desk. He leaned over the Commissioner's shoulder, taking hold of the plate and breaking the seal with his thumb nail."," \"Hang on,\" Dixon said. \"This is going to hit you hard. According to our agents on Armun, the Centauran High Council has called an emergency session to deal with the problem of Terra's impending attack. Centauran relay couriers have reported to the High Council that the Terran bomb Icarus is virtually complete. Work on the bomb has been rushed through final stages in the underground laboratories under the Ural Range, directed by the Terran physicist Peter Sherikov.\""," \"So I understand from Sherikov himself. Are you surprised the Centaurans know about the bomb? They have spies swarming over Terra. That's no news.\""," \"There's more.\" Dixon traced the message plate grimly, with an unsteady finger. \"The Centauran relay couriers reported that Peter Sherikov brought an expert mechanic out of a previous time continuum to complete the wiring of the turret!\""," Reinhart staggered, holding on tight to the desk. He closed his eyes, gasping."," \"The variable man is still alive,\" Dixon murmured. \"I don't know how. Or why. There's nothing left of the Albertines. And how the hell did the man get half way around the world?\""," Reinhart opened his eyes slowly, his face twisting. \"Sherikov! He must have removed him before the attack. I told Sherikov the attack was forthcoming. I gave him the exact hour. He had to get help--from the variable man. He couldn't meet his promise otherwise.\""," Reinhart leaped up and began to pace back and forth. \"I've already informed the SRB machines that the variable man has been destroyed. The machines now show the original 7-6 ratio in our favor. But the ratio is based on false information.\""," \"Then you'll have to withdraw the false data and restore the original situation.\""," \"No.\" Reinhart shook his head. \"I can't do that. The machines must be kept functioning. We can't allow them to jam again. It's too dangerous. If Duffe should become aware that--\""," \"What are you going to do, then?\" Dixon picked up the message plate. \"You can't leave the machines with false data. That's treason.\""," \"The data can't be withdrawn! Not unless equivalent data exists to take its place.\" Reinhart paced angrily back and forth. \"Damn it, I was certain the man was dead. This is an incredible situation. He must be eliminated--at any cost.\""," Suddenly Reinhart stopped pacing. \"The turret. It's probably finished by this time. Correct?\""," Dixon nodded slowly in agreement. \"With the variable man helping, Sherikov has undoubtedly completed work well ahead of schedule.\""," Reinhart's gray eyes flickered. \"Then he's no longer of any use--even to Sherikov. We could take a chance.... Even if there were active opposition....\""," \"What's this?\" Dixon demanded. \"What are you thinking about?\""," \"How many units are ready for immediate action? How large a force can we raise without notice?\""," \"Because of the war we're mobilized on a twenty-four hour basis. There are seventy air units and about two hundred surface units. The balance of the Security forces have been transferred to the line, under military control.\""," \"Men?\""," \"We have about five thousand men ready to go, still on Terra. Most of them in the process of being transferred to military transports. I can hold it up at any time.\""," \"Missiles?\""," \"Fortunately, the launching tubes have not yet been disassembled. They're still here on Terra. In another few days they'll be moving out for the Colonial fracas.\""," \"Then they're available for immediate use?\""," \"Yes.\""," \"Good.\" Reinhart locked his hands, knotting his fingers harshly together in sudden decision. \"That will do exactly. Unless I am completely wrong, Sherikov has only a half-dozen air units and no surface cars. And only about two hundred men. Some defense shields, of course--\""," \"What are you planning?\""," Reinhart's face was gray and hard, like stone. \"Send out orders for all available Security units to be unified under your immediate command. Have them ready to move by four o'clock this afternoon. We're going to pay a visit,\" Reinhart stated grimly. \"A surprise visit. On Peter Sherikov.\""," *****"," \"Stop here,\" Reinhart ordered."," The surface car slowed to a halt. Reinhart peered cautiously out, studying the horizon ahead."," On all sides a desert of scrub grass and sand stretched out. Nothing moved or stirred. To the right the grass and sand rose up to form immense peaks, a range of mountains without end, disappearing finally into the distance. The Urals."," \"Over there,\" Reinhart said to Dixon, pointing. \"See?\""," \"No.\""," \"Look hard. It's difficult to spot unless you know what to look for. Vertical pipes. Some kind of vent. Or periscopes.\""," Dixon saw them finally. \"I would have driven past without noticing.\""," \"It's well concealed. The main labs are a mile down. Under the range itself. It's virtually impregnable. Sherikov had it built years ago, to withstand any attack. From the air, by surface cars, bombs, missiles--\""," \"He must feel safe down there.\""," \"No doubt.\" Reinhart gazed up at the sky. A few faint black dots could be seen, moving lazily about, in broad circles. \"Those aren't ours, are they? I gave orders--\""," \"No. They're not ours. All our units are out of sight. Those belong to Sherikov. His patrol.\""," Reinhart relaxed. \"Good.\" He reached over and flicked on the vidscreen over the board of the car. \"This screen is shielded? It can't be traced?\""," \"There's no way they can spot it back to us. It's non-directional.\""," The screen glowed into life. Reinhart punched the combination keys and sat back to wait."," After a time an image formed on the screen. A heavy face, bushy black beard and large eyes."," Peter Sherikov gazed at Reinhart with surprised curiosity. \"Commissioner! Where are you calling from? What--\""," \"How's the work progressing?\" Reinhart broke in coldly. \"Is Icarus almost complete?\""," Sherikov beamed with expansive pride. \"He's done, Commissioner. Two days ahead of time. Icarus is ready to be launched into space. I tried to call your office, but they told me--\""," \"I'm not at my office.\" Reinhart leaned toward the screen. \"Open your entrance tunnel at the surface. You're about to receive visitors.\""," Sherikov blinked. \"Visitors?\""," \"I'm coming down to see you. About Icarus. Have the tunnel opened for me at once.\""," \"Exactly where are you, Commissioner?\""," \"On the surface.\""," Sherikov's eyes flickered. \"Oh? But--\""," \"Open up!\" Reinhart snapped. He glanced at his wristwatch. \"I'll be at the entrance in five minutes. I expect to find it ready for me.\""," \"Of course.\" Sherikov nodded in bewilderment. \"I'm always glad to see you, Commissioner. But I--\""," \"Five minutes, then.\" Reinhart cut the circuit. The screen died. He turned quickly to Dixon. \"You stay up here, as we arranged. I'll go down with one company of police. You understand the necessity of exact timing on this?\""," \"We won't slip up. Everything's ready. All units are in their places.\""," \"Good.\" Reinhart pushed the door open for him. \"You join your directional staff. I'll proceed toward the tunnel entrance.\""," \"Good luck.\" Dixon leaped out of the car, onto the sandy ground. A gust of dry air swirled into the car around Reinhart. \"I'll see you later.\""," Reinhart slammed the door. He turned to the group of police crouched in the rear of the car, their guns held tightly. \"Here we go,\" Reinhart murmured. \"Hold on.\""," The car raced across the sandy ground, toward the tunnel entrance to Sherikov's underground fortress."," Sherikov met Reinhart at the bottom end of the tunnel, where the tunnel opened up onto the main floor of the lab."," The big Pole approached, his hand out, beaming with pride and satisfaction. \"It's a pleasure to see you, Commissioner. This is an historic moment.\""," Reinhart got out of the car, with his group of armed Security police. \"Calls for a celebration, doesn't it?\" he said."," \"That's a good idea! We're two days ahead, Commissioner. The SRB machines will be interested. The odds should change abruptly at the news.\""," \"Let's go down to the lab. I want to see the control turret myself.\""," A shadow crossed Sherikov's face. \"I'd rather not bother the workmen right now, Commissioner. They've been under a great load, trying to complete the turret in time. I believe they're putting a few last finishes on it at this moment.\""," \"We can view them by vidscreen. I'm curious to see them at work. It must be difficult to wire such minute relays.\""," Sherikov shook his head. \"Sorry, Commissioner. No vidscreen on them. I won't allow it. This is too important. Our whole future depends on it.\""," Reinhart snapped a signal to his company of police. \"Put this man under arrest.\""," Sherikov blanched. His mouth fell open. The police moved quickly around him, their gun tubes up, jabbing into him. He was searched rapidly, efficiently. His gun belt and concealed energy screen were yanked off."," \"What's going on?\" Sherikov demanded, some color returning to his face. \"What are you doing?\""," \"You're under arrest for the duration of the war. You're relieved of all authority. From now on one of my men will operate Designs. When the war is over you'll be tried before the Council and President Duffe.\""," Sherikov shook his head, dazed. \"I don't understand. What's this all about? Explain it to me, Commissioner. What's happened?\""," Reinhart signalled to his police. \"Get ready. We're going into the lab. We may have to shoot our way in. The variable man should be in the area of the bomb, working on the control turret.\""," Instantly Sherikov's face hardened. His black eyes glittered, alert and hostile."," Reinhart laughed harshly. \"We received a counter-intelligence report from Centaurus. I'm surprised at you, Sherikov. You know the Centaurans are everywhere with their relay couriers. You should have known--\""," Sherikov moved. Fast. All at once he broke away from the police, throwing his massive body against them. They fell, scattering. Sherikov ran--directly at the wall. The police fired wildly. Reinhart fumbled frantically for his gun tube, pulling it up."," Sherikov reached the wall, running head down, energy beams flashing around him. He struck against the wall--and vanished."," \"Down!\" Reinhart shouted. He dropped to his hands and knees. All around him his police dived for the floor. Reinhart cursed wildly, dragging himself quickly toward the door. They had to get out, and right away. Sherikov had escaped. A false wall, an energy barrier set to respond to his pressure. He had dashed through it to safety. He--"," From all sides an inferno burst, a flaming roar of death surging over them, around them, on every side. The room was alive with blazing masses of destruction, bouncing from wall to wall. They were caught between four banks of power, all of them open to full discharge. A trap--a death trap."," *****"," Reinhart reached the hall gasping for breath. He leaped to his feet. A few Security police followed him. Behind them, in the flaming room, the rest of the company screamed and struggled, blasted out of existence by the leaping bursts of power."," Reinhart assembled his remaining men. Already, Sherikov's guards were forming. At one end of the corridor a snub-barreled robot gun was maneuvering into position. A siren wailed. Guards were running on all sides, hurrying to battle stations."," The robot gun opened fire. Part of the corridor exploded, bursting into fragments. Clouds of choking debris and particles swept around them. Reinhart and his police retreated, moving back along the corridor."," They reached a junction. A second robot gun was rumbling toward them, hurrying to get within range. Reinhart fired carefully, aiming at its delicate control. Abruptly the gun spun convulsively. It lashed against the wall, smashing itself into the unyielding metal. Then it collapsed in a heap, gears still whining and spinning."," \"Come on.\" Reinhart moved away, crouching and running. He glanced at his watch. Almost time. A few more minutes. A group of lab guards appeared ahead of them. Reinhart fired. Behind him his police fired past him, violet shafts of energy catching the group of guards as they entered the corridor. The guards spilled apart, falling and twisting. Part of them settled into dust, drifting down the corridor. Reinhart made his way toward the lab, crouching and leaping, pushing past heaps of debris and remains, followed by his men. \"Come on! Don't stop!\""," *****"," Suddenly from around them the booming, enlarged voice of Sherikov thundered, magnified by rows of wall speakers along the corridor. Reinhart halted, glancing around."," \"Reinhart! You haven't got a chance. You'll never get back to the surface. Throw down your guns and give up. You're surrounded on all sides. You're a mile, under the surface.\""," Reinhart threw himself into motion, pushing into billowing clouds of particles drifting along the corridor. \"Are you sure, Sherikov?\" he grunted."," Sherikov laughed, his harsh, metallic peals rolling in waves against Reinhart's eardrums. \"I don't want to have to kill you, Commissioner. You're vital to the war: I'm sorry you found out about the variable man. I admit we overlooked the Centauran espionage as a factor in this. But now that you know about him--\""," Suddenly Sherikov's voice broke off. A deep rumble had shaken the floor, a lapping vibration that shuddered through the corridor."," Reinhart sagged with relief. He peered through the clouds of debris, making out the figures on his watch. Right on time. Not a second late."," The first of the hydrogen missiles, launched from the Council buildings on the other side of the world, were beginning to arrive. The attack had begun."," At exactly six o'clock Joseph Dixon, standing on the surface four miles from the entrance tunnel, gave the sign to the waiting units."," The first job was to break down Sherikov's defense screens. The missiles had to penetrate without interference. At Dixon's signal a fleet of thirty Security ships dived from a height of ten miles, swooping above the mountains, directly over the underground laboratories. Within five minutes the defense screens had been smashed, and all the tower projectors leveled flat. Now the mountains were virtually unprotected."," \"So far so good,\" Dixon murmured, as he watched from his secure position. The fleet of Security ships roared back, their work done. Across the face of the desert the police surface cars were crawling rapidly toward the entrance tunnel, snaking from side to side."," Meanwhile, Sherikov's counter-attack had begun to go into operation."," Guns mounted among the hills opened fire. Vast columns of flame burst up in the path of the advancing cars. The cars hesitated and retreated, as the plain was churned up by a howling vortex, a thundering chaos of explosions. Here and there a car vanished in a cloud of particles. A group of cars moving away suddenly scattered, caught up by a giant wind that lashed across them and swept them up into the air."," Dixon gave orders to have the cannon silenced. The police air arm again swept overhead, a sullen roar of jets that shook the ground below. The police ships divided expertly and hurtled down on the cannon protecting the hills."," The cannon forgot the surface cars and lifted their snouts to meet the attack. Again and again the airships came, rocking the mountains with titanic blasts."," The guns became silent. Their echoing boom diminished, died away reluctantly, as bombs took critical toll of them."," Dixon watched with satisfaction as the bombing came to an end. The airships rose in a thick swarm, black gnats shooting up in triumph from a dead carcass. They hurried back as emergency anti-aircraft robot guns swung into position and saturated the sky with blazing puffs of energy."," Dixon checked his wristwatch. The missiles were already on the way from North America. Only a few minutes remained."," The surface cars, freed by the successful bombing, began to regroup for a new frontal attack. Again they crawled forward, across the burning plain, bearing down cautiously on the battered wall of mountains, heading toward the twisted wrecks that had been the ring of defense guns. Toward the entrance tunnel."," An occasional cannon fired feebly at them. The cars came grimly on. Now, in the hollows of the hills, Sherikov's troops were hurrying to the surface to meet the attack. The first car reached the shadow of the mountains...."," A deafening hail of fire burst loose. Small robot guns appeared everywhere, needle barrels emerging from behind hidden screens, trees and shrubs, rocks, stones. The police cars were caught in a withering cross-fire, trapped at the base of the hills."," Down the slopes Sherikov's guards raced, toward the stalled cars. Clouds of heat rose up and boiled across the plain as the cars fired up at the running men. A robot gun dropped like a slug onto the plain and screamed toward the cars, firing as it came."," Dixon twisted nervously. Only a few minutes. Any time, now. He shaded his eyes and peered up at the sky. No sign of them yet. He wondered about Reinhart. No signal had come up from below. Clearly, Reinhart had run into trouble. No doubt there was desperate fighting going on in the maze of underground tunnels, the intricate web of passages that honeycombed the earth below the mountains."," In the air, Sherikov's few defense ships were taking on the police raiders. Outnumbered, the defense ships darted rapidly, wildly, putting up a futile fight."," Sherikov's guards streamed out onto the plain. Crouching and running, they advanced toward the stalled cars. The police airships screeched down at them, guns thundering."," Dixon held his breath. When the missiles arrived--"," The first missile struck. A section of the mountain vanished, turned to smoke and foaming gasses. The wave of heat slapped Dixon across the face, spinning him around. Quickly he re-entered his ship and took off, shooting rapidly away from the scene. He glanced back. A second and third missile had arrived. Great gaping pits yawned among the mountains, vast sections missing like broken teeth. Now the missiles could penetrate to the underground laboratories below."," On the ground, the surface cars halted beyond the danger area, waiting for the missile attack to finish. When the eighth missile had struck, the cars again moved forward. No more missiles fell."," Dixon swung his ship around, heading back toward the scene. The laboratory was exposed. The top sections of it had been ripped open. The laboratory lay like a tin can, torn apart by mighty explosions, its first floors visible from the air. Men and cars were pouring down into it, fighting with the guards swarming to the surface."," *****"," Dixon watched intently. Sherikov's men were bringing up heavy guns, big robot artillery. But the police ships were diving again. Sherikov's defensive patrols had been cleaned from the sky. The police ships whined down, arcing over the exposed laboratory. Small bombs fell, whistling down, pin-pointing the artillery rising to the surface on the remaining lift stages."," Abruptly Dixon's vidscreen clicked. Dixon turned toward it."," Reinhart's features formed. \"Call off the attack.\" His uniform was torn. A deep bloody gash crossed his cheek. He grinned sourly at Dixon, pushing his tangled hair back out of his face. \"Quite a fight.\""," \"Sherikov--\""," \"He's called off his guards. We've agreed to a truce. It's all over. No more needed.\" Reinhart gasped for breath, wiping grime and sweat from his neck. \"Land your ship and come down here at once.\""," \"The variable man?\""," \"That comes next,\" Reinhart said grimly. He adjusted his gun tube. \"I want you down here, for that part. I want you to be in on the kill.\""," Reinhart turned away from the vidscreen. In the corner of the room Sherikov stood silently, saying nothing. \"Well?\" Reinhart barked. \"Where is he? Where will I find him?\""," Sherikov licked his lips nervously, glancing up at Reinhart. \"Commissioner, are you sure--\""," \"The attack has been called off. Your labs are safe. So is your life. Now it's your turn to come through.\" Reinhart gripped his gun, moving toward Sherikov. \"Where is he?\""," For a moment Sherikov hesitated. Then slowly his huge body sagged, defeated. He shook his head wearily. \"All right. I'll show you where he is.\" His voice was hardly audible, a dry whisper. \"Down this way. Come on.\""," Reinhart followed Sherikov out of the room, into the corridor. Police and guards were working rapidly, clearing the debris and ruins away, putting out the hydrogen fires that burned everywhere. \"No tricks, Sherikov.\""," \"No tricks.\" Sherikov nodded resignedly. \"Thomas Cole is by himself. In a wing lab off the main rooms.\""," \"Cole?\""," \"The variable man. That's his name.\" The Pole turned his massive head a little. \"He has a name.\""," Reinhart waved his gun. \"Hurry up. I don't want anything to go wrong. This is the part I came for.\""," \"You must remember something, Commissioner.\""," \"What is it?\""," Sherikov stopped walking. \"Commissioner, nothing must happen to the globe. The control turret. Everything depends on it, the war, our whole--\""," \"I know. Nothing will happen to the damn thing. Let's go.\""," \"If it should get damaged--\""," \"I'm not after the globe. I'm interested only in--in Thomas Cole.\""," They came to the end of the corridor and stopped before a metal door. Sherikov nodded at the door. \"In there.\""," Reinhart moved back. \"Open the door.\""," \"Open it yourself. I don't want to have anything to do with it.\""," Reinhart shrugged. He stepped up to the door. Holding his gun level he raised his hand, passing it in front of the eye circuit. Nothing happened."," Reinhart frowned. He pushed the door with his hand. The door slid open. Reinhart was looking into a small laboratory. He glimpsed a workbench, tools, heaps of equipment, measuring devices, and in the center of the bench the transparent globe, the control turret."," \"Cole?\" Reinhart advanced quickly into the room. He glanced around him, suddenly alarmed. \"Where--\""," The room was empty. Thomas Cole was gone."," When the first missile struck, Cole stopped work and sat listening."," Far off, a distant rumble rolled through the earth, shaking the floor under him. On the bench, tools and equipment danced up and down. A pair of pliers fell crashing to the floor. A box of screws tipped over, spilling its minute contents out."," Cole listened for a time. Presently he lifted the transparent globe from the bench. With carefully controlled hands he held the globe up, running his fingers gently over the surface, his faded blue eyes thoughtful. Then, after a time, he placed the globe back on the bench, in its mount."," The globe was finished. A faint glow of pride moved through the variable man. The globe was the finest job he had ever done."," The deep rumblings ceased. Cole became instantly alert. He jumped down from his stool, hurrying across the room to the door. For a moment he stood by the door listening intently. He could hear noise on the other side, shouts, guards rushing past, dragging heavy equipment, working frantically."," A rolling crash echoed down the corridor and lapped against his door. The concussion spun him around. Again a tide of energy shook the walls and floor and sent him down on his knees."," The lights flickered and winked out."," Cole fumbled in the dark until he found a flashlight. Power failure. He could hear crackling flames. Abruptly the lights came on again, an ugly yellow, then faded back out. Cole bent down and examined the door with his flashlight. A magnetic lock. Dependent on an externally induced electric flux. He grabbed a screwdriver and pried at the door. For a moment it held. Then it fell open."," Cole stepped warily out into the corridor. Everything was in shambles. Guards wandered everywhere, burned and half-blinded. Two lay groaning under a pile of wrecked equipment. Fused guns, reeking metal. The air was heavy with the smell of burning wiring and plastic. A thick cloud that choked him and made him bend double as he advanced."," \"Halt,\" a guard gasped feebly, struggling to rise. Cole pushed past him and down the corridor. Two small robot guns, still functioning, glided past him hurriedly toward the drumming chaos of battle. He followed."," At a major intersection the fight was in full swing. Sherikov's guards fought Security police, crouched behind pillars and barricades, firing wildly, desperately. Again the whole structure shuddered as a great booming blast ignited some place above. Bombs? Shells?"," Cole threw himself down as a violet beam cut past his ear and disintegrated the wall behind him. A Security policeman, wild-eyed, firing erratically. One of Sherikov's guards winged him and his gun skidded to the floor."," A robot cannon turned toward him as he made his way past the intersection. He began to run. The cannon rolled along behind him, aiming itself uncertainly. Cole hunched over as he shambled rapidly along, gasping for breath. In the flickering yellow light he saw a handful of Security police advancing, firing expertly, intent on a line of defense Sherikov's guards had hastily set up."," The robot cannon altered its course to take them on, and Cole escaped around a corner."," He was in the main lab, the big chamber where Icarus himself rose, the vast squat column."," Icarus! A solid wall of guards surrounded him, grim-faced, hugging guns and protection shields. But the Security police were leaving Icarus alone. Nobody wanted to damage him. Cole evaded a lone guard tracking him and reached the far side of the lab."," It took him only a few seconds to find the force field generator. There was no switch. For a moment that puzzled him--and then he remembered. The guard had controlled it from his wrist."," Too late to worry about that. With his screwdriver he unfastened the plate over the generator and ripped out the wiring in handfuls. The generator came loose and he dragged it away from the wall. The screen was off, thank God. He managed to carry the generator into a side corridor."," Crouched in a heap, Cole bent over the generator, deft fingers flying. He pulled the wiring to him and laid it out on the floor, tracing the circuits with feverish haste."," The adaptation was easier than he had expected. The screen flowed at right angles to the wiring, for a distance of six feet. Each lead was shielded on one side; the field radiated outward, leaving a hollow cone in the center. He ran the wiring through his belt, down his trouser legs, under his shirt, all the way to his wrists and ankles."," He was just snatching up the heavy generator when two Security police appeared. They raised their blasters and fired point-blank."," Cole clicked on the screen. A vibration leaped through him that snapped his jaw and danced up his body. He staggered away, half-stupefied by the surging force that radiated out from him. The violet rays struck the field and deflected harmlessly."," He was safe."," He hurried on down the corridor, past a ruined gun and sprawled bodies still clutching blasters. Great drifting clouds of radioactive particles billowed around him. He edged by one cloud nervously. Guards lay everywhere, dying and dead, partly destroyed, eaten and corroded by the hot metallic salts in the air. He had to get out--and fast."," At the end of the corridor a whole section of the fortress was in ruins. Towering flames leaped on all sides. One of the missiles had penetrated below ground level."," Cole found a lift that still functioned. A load of wounded guards was being raised to the surface. None of them paid any attention to him. Flames surged around the lift, licking at the wounded. Workmen were desperately trying to get the lift into action. Cole leaped onto the lift. A moment later it began to rise, leaving the shouts and the flames behind."," The lift emerged on the surface and Cole jumped off. A guard spotted him and gave chase. Crouching, Cole dodged into a tangled mass of twisted metal, still white-hot and smoking. He ran for a distance, leaping from the side of a ruined defense-screen tower, onto the fused ground and down the side of a hill. The ground was hot underfoot. He hurried as fast as he could, gasping for breath. He came to a long slope and scrambled up the side."," The guard who had followed was gone, lost behind in the rolling clouds of ash that drifted from the ruins of Sherikov's underground fortress."," Cole reached the top of the hill. For a brief moment he halted to get his breath and figure where he was. It was almost evening. The sun was beginning to set. In the darkening sky a few dots still twisted and rolled, black specks that abruptly burst into flame and fused out again."," Cole stood up cautiously, peering around him. Ruins stretched out below, on all sides, the furnace from which he had escaped. A chaos of incandescent metal and debris, gutted and wrecked beyond repair. Miles of tangled rubbish and half-vaporized equipment."," He considered. Everyone was busy putting out the fires and pulling the wounded to safety. It would be awhile before he was missed. But as soon as they realized he was gone they'd be after him. Most of the laboratory had been destroyed. Nothing lay back that way."," Beyond the ruins lay the great Ural peaks, the endless mountains, stretching out as far as the eye could see."," Mountains and green forests. A wilderness. They'd never find him there."," Cole started along the side of the hill, walking slowly and carefully, his screen generator under his arm. Probably in the confusion he could find enough food and equipment to last him indefinitely. He could wait until early morning, then circle back toward the ruins and load up. With a few tools and his own innate skill he would get along fine. A screwdriver, hammer, nails, odds and ends--"," A great hum sounded in his ears. It swelled to a deafening roar. Startled, Cole whirled around. A vast shape filled the sky behind him, growing each moment. Cole stood frozen, utterly transfixed. The shape thundered over him, above his head, as he stood stupidly, rooted to the spot."," Then, awkwardly, uncertainly, he began to run. He stumbled and fell and rolled a short distance down the side of the hill. Desperately, he struggled to hold onto the ground. His hands dug wildly, futilely, into the soft soil, trying to keep the generator under his arm at the same time."," A flash, and a blinding spark of light around him."," The spark picked him up and tossed him like a dry leaf. He grunted in agony as searing fire crackled about him, a blazing inferno that gnawed and ate hungrily through his screen. He spun dizzily and fell through the cloud of fire, down into a pit of darkness, a vast gulf between two hills. His wiring ripped off. The generator tore out of his grip and was lost behind. Abruptly, his force field ceased."," Cole lay in the darkness at the bottom of the hill. His whole body shrieked in agony as the unholy fire played over him. He was a blazing cinder, a half-consumed ash flaming in a universe of darkness. The pain made him twist and crawl like an insect, trying to burrow into the ground. He screamed and shrieked and struggled to escape, to get away from the hideous fire. To reach the curtain of darkness beyond, where it was cool and silent, where the flames couldn't crackle and eat at him."," He reached imploringly out, into the darkness, groping feebly toward it, trying to pull himself into it. Gradually, the glowing orb that was his own body faded. The impenetrable chaos of night descended. He allowed the tide to sweep over him, to extinguish the searing fire."," Dixon landed his ship expertly, bringing it to a halt in front of an overturned defense tower. He leaped out and hurried across the smoking ground."," From a lift Reinhart appeared, surrounded by his Security police. \"He got away from us! He escaped!\""," \"He didn't escape,\" Dixon answered. \"I got him myself.\""," Reinhart quivered violently. \"What do you mean?\""," \"Come along with me. Over in this direction.\" He and Reinhart climbed the side of a demolished hill, both of them panting for breath. \"I was landing. I saw a figure emerge from a lift and run toward the mountains, like some sort of animal. When he came out in the open I dived on him and released a phosphorus bomb.\""," \"Then he's--dead?\""," \"I don't see how anyone could have lived through a phosphorus bomb.\" They reached the top of the hill. Dixon halted, then pointed excitedly down into the pit beyond the hill. \"There!\""," They descended cautiously. The ground was singed and burned clean. Clouds of smoke hung heavily in the air. Occasional fires still flickered here and there. Reinhart coughed and bent over to see. Dixon flashed on a pocket flare and set it beside the body."," The body was charred, half destroyed by the burning phosphorus. It lay motionless, one arm over its face, mouth open, legs sprawled grotesquely. Like some abandoned rag doll, tossed in an incinerator and consumed almost beyond recognition."," \"He's alive!\" Dixon muttered. He felt around curiously. \"Must have had some kind of protection screen. Amazing that a man could--\""," \"It's him? It's really him?\""," \"Fits the description.\" Dixon tore away a handful of burned clothing. \"This is the variable man. What's left of him, at least.\""," Reinhart sagged with relief. \"Then we've finally got him. The data is accurate. He's no longer a factor.\""," Dixon got out his blaster and released the safety catch thoughtfully. \"If you want, I can finish the job right now.\""," At that moment Sherikov appeared, accompanied by two armed Security police. He strode grimly down the hillside, black eyes snapping. \"Did Cole--\" He broke off. \"Good God.\""," \"Dixon got him with a phosphorus bomb,\" Reinhart said noncommittally. \"He had reached the surface and was trying to get into the mountains.\""," Sherikov turned wearily away. \"He was an amazing person. During the attack he managed to force the lock on his door and escape. The guards fired at him, but nothing happened. He had rigged up some kind of force field around him. Something he adapted.\""," \"Anyhow, it's over with,\" Reinhart answered. \"Did you have SRB plates made up on him?\""," Sherikov reached slowly into his coat. He drew out a manila envelope. \"Here's all the information I collected about him, while he was with me.\""," \"Is it complete? Everything previous has been merely fragmentary.\""," \"As near complete as I could make it. It includes photographs and diagrams of the interior of the globe. The turret wiring he did for me. I haven't had a chance even to look at them.\" Sherikov fingered the envelope. \"What are you going to do with Cole?\""," \"Have him loaded up, taken back to the city--and officially put to sleep by the Euthanasia Ministry.\""," \"Legal murder?\" Sherikov's lips twisted. \"Why don't you simply do it right here and get it over with?\""," Reinhart grabbed the envelope and stuck it in his pocket. \"I'll turn this right over to the machines.\" He motioned to Dixon. \"Let's go. Now we can notify the fleet to prepare for the attack on Centaurus.\" He turned briefly back to Sherikov. \"When can Icarus be launched?\""," \"In an hour or so, I suppose. They're locking the control turret in place. Assuming it functions correctly, that's all that's needed.\""," \"Good. I'll notify Duffe to send out the signal to the warfleet.\" Reinhart nodded to the police to take Sherikov to the waiting Security ship. Sherikov moved off dully, his face gray and haggard. Cole's inert body was picked up and tossed onto a freight cart. The cart rumbled into the hold of the Security ship and the lock slid shut after it."," \"It'll be interesting to see how the machines respond to the additional data,\" Dixon said."," \"It should make quite an improvement in the odds,\" Reinhart agreed. He patted the envelope, bulging in his inside pocket. \"We're two days ahead of time.\""," *****"," Margaret Duffe got up slowly from her desk. She pushed her chair automatically back. \"Let me get all this straight. You mean the bomb is finished? Ready to go?\""," Reinhart nodded impatiently. \"That's what I said. The Technicians are checking the turret locks to make sure it's properly attached. The launching will take place in half an hour.\""," \"Thirty minutes! Then--\""," \"Then the attack can begin at once. I assume the fleet is ready for action.\""," \"Of course. It's been ready for several days. But I can't believe the bomb is ready so soon.\" Margaret Duffe moved numbly toward the door of her office. \"This is a great day, Commissioner. An old era lies behind us. This time tomorrow Centaurus will be gone. And eventually the colonies will be ours.\""," \"It's been a long climb,\" Reinhart murmured."," \"One thing. Your charge against Sherikov. It seems incredible that a person of his caliber could ever--\""," \"We'll discuss that later,\" Reinhart interrupted coldly. He pulled the manila envelope from his coat. \"I haven't had an opportunity to feed the additional data to the SRB machines. If you'll excuse me, I'll do that now.\""," *****"," For a moment Margaret Duffe stood at the door. The two of them faced each other silently, neither speaking, a faint smile on Reinhart's thin lips, hostility in the woman's blue eyes."," \"Reinhart, sometimes I think perhaps you'll go too far. And sometimes I think you've already gone too far....\""," \"I'll inform you of any change in the odds showing.\" Reinhart strode past her, out of the office and down the hall. He headed toward the SRB room, an intense thalamic excitement rising up inside him."," A few moments later he entered the SRB room. He made his way to the machines. The odds 7-6 showed in the view windows. Reinhart smiled a little. 7-6. False odds, based on incorrect information. Now they could be removed."," Kaplan hurried over. Reinhart handed him the envelope, and moved over to the window, gazing down at the scene below. Men and cars scurried frantically everywhere. Officials coming and going like ants, hurrying in all directions."," The war was on. The signal had been sent out to the warfleet that had waited so long near Proxima Centaurus. A feeling of triumph raced through Reinhart. He had won. He had destroyed the man from the past and broken Peter Sherikov. The war had begun as planned. Terra was breaking out. Reinhart smiled thinly. He had been completely successful."," \"Commissioner.\""," Reinhart turned slowly. \"All right.\""," Kaplan was standing in front of the machines, gazing down at the reading. \"Commissioner--\""," Sudden alarm plucked at Reinhart. There was something in Kaplan's voice. He hurried quickly over. \"What is it?\""," Kaplan looked up at him, his face white, his eyes wide with terror. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound came."," \"What is it?\" Reinhart demanded, chilled. He bent toward the machines, studying the reading."," And sickened with horror."," 100-1. Against Terra!"," He could not tear his gaze away from the figures. He was numb, shocked with disbelief. 100-1. What had happened? What had gone wrong? The turret was finished, Icarus was ready, the fleet had been notified--"," There was a sudden deep buzz from outside the building. Shouts drifted up from below. Reinhart turned his head slowly toward the window, his heart frozen with fear."," Across the evening sky a trail moved, rising each moment. A thin line of white. Something climbed, gaining speed each moment. On the ground, all eyes were turned toward it, awed faces peering up."," The object gained speed. Faster and faster. Then it vanished. Icarus was on his way. The attack had begun; it was too late to stop, now."," And on the machines the odds read a hundred to one--for failure."," At eight o'clock in the evening of May 15, 2136, Icarus was launched toward the star Centaurus. A day later, while all Terra waited, Icarus entered the star, traveling at thousands of times the speed of light."," Nothing happened. Icarus disappeared into the star. There was no explosion. The bomb failed to go off."," At the same time the Terran warfleet engaged the Centauran outer fleet, sweeping down in a concentrated attack. Twenty major ships were seized. A good part of the Centauran fleet was destroyed. Many of the captive systems began to revolt, in the hope of throwing off the Imperial bonds."," Two hours later the massed Centauran warfleet from Armun abruptly appeared and joined battle. The great struggle illuminated half the Centauran system. Ship after ship flashed briefly and then faded to ash. For a whole day the two fleets fought, strung out over millions of miles of space. Innumerable fighting men died--on both sides."," At last the remains of the battered Terran fleet turned and limped toward Armun--defeated. Little of the once impressive armada remained. A few blackened hulks, making their way uncertainly toward captivity."," Icarus had not functioned. Centaurus had not exploded. The attack was a failure."," The war was over."," \"We've lost the war,\" Margaret Duffe said in a small voice, wondering and awed. \"It's over. Finished.\""," The Council members sat in their places around the conference table, gray-haired elderly men, none of them speaking or moving. All gazed up mutely at the great stellar maps that covered two walls of the chamber."," \"I have already empowered negotiators to arrange a truce,\" Margaret Duffe murmured. \"Orders have been sent out to Vice-Commander Jessup to give up the battle. There's no hope. Fleet Commander Carleton destroyed himself and his flagship a few minutes ago. The Centauran High Council has agreed to end the fighting. Their whole Empire is rotten to the core. Ready to topple of its own weight.\""," Reinhart was slumped over at the table, his head in his hands. \"I don't understand.... Why? Why didn't the bomb explode?\" He mopped his forehead shakily. All his poise was gone. He was trembling and broken. \"What went wrong?\""," Gray-faced, Dixon mumbled an answer. \"The variable man must have sabotaged the turret. The SRB machines knew.... They analyzed the data. They knew! But it was too late.\""," Reinhart's eyes were bleak with despair as he raised his head a little. \"I knew he'd destroy us. We're finished. A century of work and planning.\" His body knotted in a spasm of furious agony. \"All because of Sherikov!\""," *****"," Margaret Duffe eyed Reinhart coldly. \"Why because of Sherikov?\""," \"He kept Cole alive! I wanted him killed from the start.\" Suddenly Reinhart jumped from his chair. His hand clutched convulsively at his gun. \"And he's still alive! Even if we've lost I'm going to have the pleasure of putting a blast beam through Cole's chest!\""," \"Sit down!\" Margaret Duffe ordered."," Reinhart was half way to the door. \"He's still at the Euthanasia Ministry, waiting for the official--\""," \"No, he's not,\" Margaret Duffe said."," Reinhart froze. He turned slowly, as if unable to believe his senses. \"What?\""," \"Cole isn't at the Ministry. I ordered him transferred and your instructions cancelled.\""," \"Where--where is he?\""," There was unusual hardness in Margaret Duffe's voice as she answered. \"With Peter Sherikov. In the Urals. I had Sherikov's full authority restored. I then had Cole transferred there, put in Sherikov's safe keeping. I want to make sure Cole recovers, so we can keep our promise to him--our promise to return him to his own time.\""," Reinhart's mouth opened and closed. All the color had drained from his face. His cheek muscles twitched spasmodically. At last he managed to speak. \"You've gone insane! The traitor responsible for Earth's greatest defeat--\""," \"We have lost the war,\" Margaret Duffe stated quietly. \"But this is not a day of defeat. It is a day of victory. The most incredible victory Terra has ever had.\""," Reinhart and Dixon were dumbfounded. \"What--\" Reinhart gasped. \"What do you--\" The whole room was in an uproar. All the Council members were on their feet. Reinhart's words were drowned out."," \"Sherikov will explain when he gets here,\" Margaret Duffe's calm voice came. \"He's the one who discovered it.\" She looked around the chamber at the incredulous Council members. \"Everyone stay in his seat. You are all to remain here until Sherikov arrives. It's vital you hear what he has to say. His news transforms this whole situation.\""," *****"," Peter Sherikov accepted the briefcase of papers from his armed technician. \"Thanks.\" He pushed his chair back and glanced thoughtfully around the Council chamber. \"Is everybody ready to hear what I have to say?\""," \"We're ready,\" Margaret Duffe answered. The Council members sat alertly around the table. At the far end, Reinhart and Dixon watched uneasily as the big Pole removed papers from his briefcase and carefully examined them."," \"To begin, I recall to you the original work behind the ftl bomb. Jamison Hedge was the first human to propel an object at a speed greater than light. As you know, that object diminished in length and gained in mass as it moved toward light speed. When it reached that speed it vanished. It ceased to exist in our terms. Having no length it could not occupy space. It rose to a different order of existence."," \"When Hedge tried to bring the object back, an explosion occurred. Hedge was killed, and all his equipment was destroyed. The force of the blast was beyond calculation. Hedge had placed his observation ship many millions of miles away. It was not far enough, however. Originally, he had hoped his drive might be used for space travel. But after his death the principle was abandoned."," \"That is--until Icarus. I saw the possibilities of a bomb, an incredibly powerful bomb to destroy Centaurus and all the Empire's forces. The reappearance of Icarus would mean the annihilation of their System. As Hedge had shown, the object would re-enter space already occupied by matter, and the cataclysm would be beyond belief.\""," \"But Icarus never came back,\" Reinhart cried. \"Cole altered the wiring so the bomb kept on going. It's probably still going.\""," \"Wrong,\" Sherikov boomed. \"The bomb did reappear. But it didn't explode.\""," Reinhart reacted violently. \"You mean--\""," \"The bomb came back, dropping below the ftl speed as soon as it entered the star Proxima. But it did not explode. There was no cataclysm. It reappeared and was absorbed by the sun, turned into gas at once.\""," \"Why didn't it explode?\" Dixon demanded."," \"Because Thomas Cole solved Hedge's problem. He found a way to bring the ftl object back into this universe without collision. Without an explosion. The variable man found what Hedge was after....\""," The whole Council was on its feet. A growing murmur filled the chamber, a rising pandemonium breaking out on all sides."," \"I don't believe it!\" Reinhart gasped. \"It isn't possible. If Cole solved Hedge's problem that would mean--\" He broke off, staggered."," \"Faster than light drive can now be used for space travel,\" Sherikov continued, waving the noise down. \"As Hedge intended. My men have studied the photographs of the control turret. They don't know how or why, yet. But we have complete records of the turret. We can duplicate the wiring, as soon as the laboratories have been repaired.\""," Comprehension was gradually beginning to settle over the room. \"Then it'll be possible to build ftl ships,\" Margaret Duffe murmured, dazed. \"And if we can do that--\""," \"When I showed him the control turret, Cole understood its purpose. Not my purpose, but the original purpose Hedge had been working toward. Cole realized Icarus was actually an incomplete spaceship, not a bomb at all. He saw what Hedge had seen, an ftl space drive. He set out to make Icarus work.\""," \"We can go beyond Centaurus,\" Dixon muttered. His lips twisted. \"Then the war was trivial. We can leave the Empire completely behind. We can go beyond the galaxy.\""," \"The whole universe is open to us,\" Sherikov agreed. \"Instead of taking over an antiquated Empire, we have the entire cosmos to map and explore, God's total creation.\""," Margaret Duffe got to her feet and moved slowly toward the great stellar maps that towered above them at the far end of the chamber. She stood for a long time, gazing up at the myriad suns, the legions of systems, awed by what she saw."," \"Do you suppose he realized all this?\" she asked suddenly. \"What we can see, here on these maps?\""," \"Thomas Cole is a strange person,\" Sherikov said, half to himself. \"Apparently he has a kind of intuition about machines, the way things are supposed to work. An intuition more in his hands than in his head. A kind of genius, such as a painter or a pianist has. Not a scientist. He has no verbal knowledge about things, no semantic references. He deals with the things themselves. Directly."," \"I doubt very much if Thomas Cole understood what would come about. He looked into the globe, the control turret. He saw unfinished wiring and relays. He saw a job half done. An incomplete machine.\""," \"Something to be fixed,\" Margaret Duffe put in."," \"Something to be fixed. Like an artist, he saw his work ahead of him. He was interested in only one thing: turning out the best job he could, with the skill he possessed. For us, that skill has opened up a whole universe, endless galaxies and systems to explore. Worlds without end. Unlimited, untouched worlds.\""," Reinhart got unsteadily to his feet. \"We better get to work. Start organizing construction teams. Exploration crews. We'll have to reconvert from war production to ship designing. Begin the manufacture of mining and scientific instruments for survey work.\""," \"That's right,\" Margaret Duffe said. She looked reflectively up at him. \"But you're not going to have anything to do with it.\""," Reinhart saw the expression on her face. His hand flew to his gun and he backed quickly toward the door. Dixon leaped up and joined him. \"Get back!\" Reinhart shouted."," Margaret Duffe signalled and a phalanx of Government troops closed in around the two men. Grim-faced, efficient soldiers with magnetic grapples ready."," Reinhart's blaster wavered--toward the Council members sitting shocked in their seats, and toward Margaret Duffe, straight at her blue eyes. Reinhart's features were distorted with insane fear. \"Get back! Don't anybody come near me or she'll be the first to get it!\""," Peter Sherikov slid from the table and with one great stride swept his immense bulk in front of Reinhart. His huge black-furred fist rose in a smashing arc. Reinhart sailed against the wall, struck with ringing force and then slid slowly to the floor."," The Government troops threw their grapples quickly around him and jerked him to his feet. His body was frozen rigid. Blood dripped from his mouth. He spat bits of tooth, his eyes glazed over. Dixon stood dazed, mouth open, uncomprehending, as the grapples closed around his arms and legs."," Reinhart's gun skidded to the floor as he was yanked toward the door. One of the elderly Council members picked the gun up and examined it curiously. He laid it carefully on the table. \"Fully loaded,\" he murmured. \"Ready to fire.\""," Reinhart's battered face was dark with hate. \"I should have killed all of you. All of you!\" An ugly sneer twisted across his shredded lips. \"If I could get my hands loose--\""," \"You won't,\" Margaret Duffe said. \"You might as well not even bother to think about it.\" She signalled to the troops and they pulled Reinhart and Dixon roughly out of the room, two dazed figures, snarling and resentful."," For a moment the room was silent. Then the Council members shuffled nervously in their seats, beginning to breathe again."," Sherikov came over and put his big paw on Margaret Duffe's shoulder. \"Are you all right, Margaret?\""," She smiled faintly. \"I'm fine. Thanks....\""," Sherikov touched her soft hair briefly. Then he broke away and began to pack up his briefcase busily. \"I have to go. I'll get in touch with you later.\""," \"Where are you going?\" she asked hesitantly. \"Can't you stay and--\""," \"I have to get back to the Urals.\" Sherikov grinned at her over his bushy black beard as he headed out of the room. \"Some very important business to attend to.\""," *****"," Thomas Cole was sitting up in bed when Sherikov came to the door. Most of his awkward, hunched-over body was sealed in a thin envelope of transparent airproof plastic. Two robot attendants whirred ceaselessly at his side, their leads contacting his pulse, blood-pressure, respiration, body temperature."," Cole turned a little as the huge Pole tossed down his briefcase and seated himself on the window ledge."," \"How are you feeling?\" Sherikov asked him."," \"Better.\""," \"You see we've quite advanced therapy. Your burns should be healed in a few months.\""," \"How is the war coming?\""," \"The war is over.\""," Cole's lips moved. \"Icarus--\""," \"Icarus went as expected. As you expected.\" Sherikov leaned toward the bed. \"Cole, I promised you something. I mean to keep my promise--as soon as you're well enough.\""," \"To return me to my own time?\""," \"That's right. It's a relatively simple matter, now that Reinhart has been removed from power. You'll be back home again, back in your own time, your own world. We can supply you with some discs of platinum or something of the kind to finance your business. You'll need a new Fixit truck. Tools. And clothes. A few thousand dollars ought to do it.\""," Cole was silent."," \"I've already contacted histo-research,\" Sherikov continued. \"The time bubble is ready as soon as you are. We're somewhat beholden to you, as you probably realize. You've made it possible for us to actualize our greatest dream. The whole planet is seething with excitement. We're changing our economy over from war to--\""," \"They don't resent what happened? The dud must have made an awful lot of people feel downright bad.\""," \"At first. But they got over it--as soon as they understood what was ahead. Too bad you won't be here to see it, Cole. A whole world breaking loose. Bursting out into the universe. They want me to have an ftl ship ready by the end of the week! Thousands of applications are already on file, men and women wanting to get in on the initial flight.\""," Cole smiled a little, \"There won't be any band, there. No parade or welcoming committee waiting for them.\""," \"Maybe not. Maybe the first ship will wind up on some dead world, nothing but sand and dried salt. But everybody wants to go. It's almost like a holiday. People running around and shouting and throwing things in the streets."," \"Afraid I must get back to the labs. Lots of reconstruction work being started.\" Sherikov dug into his bulging briefcase. \"By the way.... One little thing. While you're recovering here, you might like to look at these.\" He tossed a handful of schematics on the bed."," Cole picked them up slowly. \"What's this?\""," \"Just a little thing I designed.\" Sherikov arose and lumbered toward the door. \"We're realigning our political structure to eliminate any recurrence of the Reinhart affair. This will block any more one-man power grabs.\" He jabbed a thick finger at the schematics. \"It'll turn power over to all of us, not to just a limited number one person could dominate--the way Reinhart dominated the Council."," \"This gimmick makes it possible for citizens to raise and decide issues directly. They won't have to wait for the Council to verbalize a measure. Any citizen can transmit his will with one of these, make his needs register on a central control that automatically responds. When a large enough segment of the population wants a certain thing done, these little gadgets set up an active field that touches all the others. An issue won't have to go through a formal Council. The citizens can express their will long before any bunch of gray-haired old men could get around to it.\""," *****"," Sherikov broke off, frowning."," \"Of course,\" he continued slowly, \"there's one little detail....\""," \"What's that?\""," \"I haven't been able to get a model to function. A few bugs.... Such intricate work never was in my line.\" He paused at the door. \"Well, I hope I'll see you again before you go. Maybe if you feel well enough later on we could get together for one last talk. Maybe have dinner together sometime. Eh?\""," But Thomas Cole wasn't listening. He was bent over the schematics, an intense frown on his weathered face. His long fingers moved restlessly over the schematics, tracing wiring and terminals. His lips moved as he calculated."," Sherikov waited a moment. Then he stepped out into the hall and softly closed the door after him."," He whistled merrily as he strode off down the corridor."],"excerpt":"He fixed things--clocks, refrigerators, vidsenders and destinies.

Tony Rossi yawned, stirred a little, then opened his black eyes and sat up quickly. With one motion he tossed the covers back and slid to the warm metal floor. He clicked off his alarm clock and hurried to the closet."," It looked like a nice day. The landscape outside was motionless, undisturbed by winds or dust-shift. The boy's heart pounded excitedly. He pulled his trousers on, zipped up the reinforced mesh, struggled into his heavy canvas shirt, and then sat down on the edge of the cot to tug on his boots. He closed the seams around their tops and then did the same with his gloves. Next he adjusted the pressure on his pump unit and strapped it between his shoulder blades. He grabbed his helmet from the dresser, and he was ready for the day."," In the dining-compartment his mother and father had finished breakfast. Their voices drifted to him as he clattered down the ramp. A disturbed murmur; he paused to listen. What were they talking about? Had he done something wrong, again?"," And then he caught it. Behind their voices was another voice. Static and crackling pops. The all-system audio signal from Rigel IV. They had it turned up full blast; the dull thunder of the monitor's voice boomed loudly. The war. Always the war. He sighed, and stepped out into the dining-compartment."," \"Morning,\" his father muttered."," \"Good morning, dear,\" his mother said absently. She sat with her head turned to one side, wrinkles of concentration webbing her forehead. Her thin lips were drawn together in a tight line of concern. His father had pushed his dirty dishes back and was smoking, elbows on the table, dark hairy arms bare and muscular. He was scowling, intent on the jumbled roar from the speaker above the sink."," \"How's it going?\" Tony asked. He slid into his chair and reached automatically for the ersatz grapefruit. \"Any news from Orion?\""," Neither of them answered. They didn't hear him. He began to eat his grapefruit. Outside, beyond the little metal and plastic housing unit, sounds of activity grew. Shouts and muffled crashes, as rural merchants and their trucks rumbled along the highway toward Karnet. The reddish daylight swelled; Betelgeuse was rising quietly and majestically."," \"Nice day,\" Tony said. \"No flux wind. I think I'll go down to the n-quarter awhile. We're building a neat spaceport, a model, of course, but we've been able to get enough materials to lay out strips for--\""," With a savage snarl his father reached out and struck the audio roar immediately died. \"I knew it!\" He got up and moved angrily away from the table. \"I told them it would happen.

Sunlight glittered from the metal roof of his family's housing unit, one of endless rows of squat boxes set in the sandy slope, protected by the line of ore-refining installations against the horizon. He made an impatient signal, and from the storage shed his EEP came gliding out, catching the sunlight on its chrome trim."," \"We're going down into Karnet,\" Tony said, unconsciously slipping into the Pas dialect. \"Hurry up!\""," The EEP took up its position behind him, and he started briskly down the slope, over the shifting sand, toward the road. There were quite a few traders out, today. It was a good day for the market; only a fourth of the year was fit for travel. Betelgeuse was an erratic and undependable sun, not at all like Sol (according to the edutapes, fed to Tony four hours a day, six days a week--he had never seen Sol himself)."," He reached the noisy road. Pas-udeti were everywhere. Whole groups of them, with their primitive combustion-driven trucks, battered and filthy, motors grinding protestingly. He waved at the trucks as they pushed past him. After a moment one slowed down. It was piled with _tis_, bundled heaps of gray vegetables dried, and prepared for the table. A staple of the Pas-udeti diet. Behind the wheel lounged a dark-faced elderly Pas, one arm over the open window, a rolled leaf between his lips. He was like all other Pas-udeti; lank and hard-shelled, encased in a brittle sheath in which he lived and died."," \"You want a ride?\" the Pas murmured--required protocol when an Earthman on foot was encountered."," \"Is there room for my EEP?\""," The Pas made a careless motion with his claw. \"It can run behind.\" Sardonic amusement touched his ugly old face. \"If it gets to Karnet we'll sell it for scrap. We can use a few condensers and relay tubing. We're short on electronic maintenance stuff.\""," \"I know,\" Tony said solemnly, as he climbed into the cabin of the truck. \"It's all been sent to the big repair base at Orion I. For your warfleet.\""," Amusement vanished from the leathery face. \"Yes, the warfleet.\" He turned away and started up the truck again. In the back, Tony's EEP had scrambled up on the load of _tis_ and was gripping precariously with its magnetic lines."," Tony noticed the Pas-udeti's sudden change of expression, and he was puzzled. He started to speak to him--but now he noticed unusual quietness among the other Pas, in the other trucks, behind and in front of his own. The war, of course. It had swept through this system a century ago; these people had been left behind. Now all eyes were on Orion, on the battle between the Terran warfleet and the Pas-udeti collection of armed freighters."," \"Is it true,\" Tony asked carefully, \"that you're winning?\""," The elderly Pas grunted. \"We hear rumors.\""," Tony considered. \"My father says Terra went ahead too fast. He says we should have consolidated. We didn't assemble adequate supply bases. He used to be an officer, when he was younger. He was with the fleet for two years.\""," The Pas was silent a moment. \"It's true,\" he said at last, \"that when you're so far from home, supply is a great problem. We, on the other hand, don't have that. We have no distances to cover.\""," \"Do you know anybody fighting?\""," \"I have distant relatives.\" The answer was vague; the Pas obviously didn't want to talk about it."," \"Have you ever seen your warfleet?\""," \"Not as it exists now. When this system was defeated most of our units were wiped out. Remnants limped to Orion and joined the Orion fleet.\""," \"Your relatives were with the remnants?\""," \"That's right.\""," \"Then you were alive when this planet was taken?\""," \"Why do you ask?\" The old Pas quivered violently. \"What business is it of yours?\""," Tony leaned out and watched the walls and buildings of Karnet grow ahead of them. Karnet was an old city. It had stood thousands of years. The Pas-udeti civilization was stable; it had reached a certain point of technocratic development and then leveled off. The Pas had inter-system ships that had carried people and freight between planets in the days before the Terran Confederation. They had combustion-driven cars, audiophones, a power network of a magnetic type. Their plumbing was satisfactory and their medicine was highly advanced. They had art forms, emotional and exciting. They had a vague religion."," \"Who do you think will win the battle?\" Tony asked."," \"I don't know.\" With a sudden jerk the old Pas brought the truck to a crashing halt. \"This is as far as I go. Please get out and take your EEP with you.\""," Tony faltered in surprise. \"But aren't you going--?\""," \"No farther!\""," Tony pushed the door open. He was vaguely uneasy; there was a hard, fixed expression on the leathery face, and the old creature's voice had a sharp edge he had never heard before. \"Thanks,\" he murmured. He hopped down into the red dust and signaled his EEP. It released its magnetic lines, and instantly the truck started up with a roar, passing on inside the city."," Tony watched it go, still dazed. The hot dust lapped at his ankles; he automatically moved his feet and slapped at his trousers. A truck honked, and his EEP quickly moved him from the road, up to the level pedestrian ramp. Pas-udeti in swarms moved by, endless lines of rural people hurrying into Karnet on their daily business. A massive public bus had stopped by the gate and was letting off passengers. Male and female Pas. And children. They laughed and shouted; the sounds of their voices blended with the low hum of the city."," \"Going in?\" a sharp Pas-udeti voice sounded close behind him. \"Keep moving--you're blocking the ramp.\""," It was a young female, with a heavy armload clutched in her claws. Tony felt embarrassed; female Pas had a certain telepathic ability, part of their sexual make-up. It was effective on Earthmen at close range."," \"Here,\" she said. \"Give me a hand.\""," Tony nodded his head, and the EEP accepted the female's heavy armload. \"I'm visiting the city,\" Tony said, as they moved with the crowd toward the gates. \"I got a ride most of the way, but the driver let me off out here.\""," \"You're from the settlement?\""," \"Yes.\""," She eyed him critically. \"You've always lived here, haven't you?\""," \"I was born here. My family came here from Earth four years before I was born. My father was an officer in the fleet. He earned an Emigration Priority.\""," \"So you've never seen your own planet. How old are you?\""," \"Ten years. Terran.\""," \"You shouldn't have asked the driver so many questions.\""," They passed through the decontamination shield and into the city. An information square loomed ahead; Pas men and women were packed around it. Moving chutes and transport cars rumbled everywhere. Buildings and ramps and open-air machinery; the city was sealed in a protective dust-proof envelope. Tony unfastened his helmet and clipped it to his belt. The air was stale-smelling, artificial, but usable."," \"Let me tell you something,\" the young female said carefully, as she strode along the foot-ramp beside Tony. \"I wonder if this is a good day for you to come into Karnet. I know you've been coming here regularly to play with your friends. But perhaps today you ought to stay at home, in your settlement.\""," \"Why?\""," \"Because today everybody is upset.\""," \"I know,\" Tony said. \"My mother and father were upset. They were listening to the news from our base in the Rigel system.\""," \"I don't mean your family. Other people are listening, too. These people here. My race.\""," \"They're upset, all right,\" Tony admitted. \"But I come here all the time. There's nobody to play with at the settlement, and anyhow we're working on a project.\""," \"A model spaceport.\""," \"That's right.\" Tony was envious. \"I sure wish I was a telepath. It must be fun.\""," The female Pas-udeti was silent. She was deep in thought. \"What would happen,\" she asked, \"if your family left here and returned to Earth?\""," \"That couldn't happen. There's no room for us on Earth. C-bombs destroyed most of Asia and North America back in the Twentieth Century.\""," \"Suppose you _had_ to go back?\""," Tony did not understand. \"But we can't. Habitable portions of Earth are overcrowded. Our main problem is finding places for Terrans to live, in other systems.\" He added, \"And anyhow, I don't particularly want to go to Terra. I'm used to it here. All my friends are here.\""," \"I'll take my packages,\" the female said. \"I go this other way, down this third-level ramp.\""," Tony nodded to his EEP and it lowered the bundles into the female's claws. She lingered a moment, trying to find the right words."," \"Good luck,\" she said."," \"With what?\""," She smiled faintly, ironically. \"With your model spaceport. I hope you and your friends get to finish it.\""," \"Of course we'll finish it,\" Tony said, surprised. \"It's almost done.\" What did she mean?"," The Pas-udeti woman hurried off before he could ask her. Tony was troubled and uncertain; more doubts filled him. After a moment he headed slowly into the lane that took him toward the residential section of the city. Past the stores and factories, to the place where his friends lived."," The group of Pas-udeti children eyed him silently as he approached. They had been playing in the shade of an immense _hengelo_, whose ancient branches drooped and swayed with the air currents pumped through the city. Now they sat unmoving."," \"I didn't expect you today,\" B'prith said, in an expressionless voice."," Tony halted awkwardly, and his EEP did the same. \"How are things?\" he murmured."," \"Fine.\""," \"I got a ride part way.\""," \"Fine.\""," Tony squatted down in the shade. None of the Pas children stirred. They were small, not as large as Terran children. Their shells had not hardened, had not turned dark and opaque, like horn. It gave them a soft, unformed appearance, but at the same time it lightened their load. They moved more easily than their elders; they could hop and skip around, still. But they were not skipping right now."," \"What's the matter?\" Tony demanded. \"What's wrong with everybody?\""," No one answered."," \"Where's the model?\" he asked. \"Have you fellows been working on it?\""," After a moment Llyre nodded slightly."," Tony felt dull anger rise up inside him. \"Say something! What's the matter? What're you all mad about?\""," \"Mad?\" B'prith echoed. \"We're not mad.\""," Tony scratched aimlessly in the dust. He knew what it was. The war, again. The battle going on near Orion. His anger burst up wildly. \"Forget the war. Everything was fine yesterday, before the battle.\""," \"Sure,\" Llyre said. \"It was fine.\""," Tony caught the edge to his voice. \"It happened a hundred years ago. It's not my fault.\""," \"Sure,\" B'prith said."," \"This is my home. Isn't it? Haven't I got as much right here as anybody else? I was born here.\""," \"Sure,\" Llyre said, tonelessly."," Tony appealed to them helplessly. \"Do you have to act this way? You didn't act this way yesterday. I was here yesterday--all of us were here yesterday. What's happened since yesterday?\""," \"The battle,\" B'prith said."," \"What difference does _that_ make? Why does that change everything? There's always war. There've been battles all the time, as long as I can remember. What's different about this?\""," B'prith broke apart a clump of dirt with his strong claws. After a moment he tossed it away and got slowly to his feet. \"Well,\" he said thoughtfully, \"according to our audio relay, it looks as if our fleet is going to win, this time.\""," \"Yes,\" Tony agreed, not understanding. \"My father says we didn't build up adequate supply bases. We'll probably have to fall back to....\" And then the impact hit him. \"You mean, for the first time in a hundred years--\""," \"Yes,\" Llyre said, also getting up. The others got up, too. They moved away from Tony, toward the near-by house. \"We're winning. The Terran flank was turned, half an hour ago. Your right wing has folded completely.\""," Tony was stunned. \"And it matters. It matters to all of you.\""," \"Matters!\" B'prith halted, suddenly blazing out in fury. \"Sure it matters! For the first time--in a century. The first time in our lives we're beating you. We have you on the run, you--\" He choked out the word, almost spat it out. \"You white-grubs!\""," They disappeared into the house. Tony sat gazing stupidly down at the ground, his hands still moving aimlessly. He had heard the word before, seen it scrawled on walls and in the dust near the settlement. _White-grubs._ The Pas term of derision for Terrans. Because of their softness, their whiteness. Lack of hard shells. Pulpy, doughy skin. But they had never dared say it out loud, before. To an Earthman's face."," Beside him, his EEP stirred restlessly. Its intricate radio mechanism sensed the hostile atmosphere. Automatic relays were sliding into place; circuits were opening and closing."," \"It's all right,\" Tony murmured, getting slowly up. \"Maybe we'd better go back.\""," He moved unsteadily toward the ramp, completely shaken. The EEP walked calmly ahead, its metal face blank and confident, feeling nothing, saying nothing. Tony's thoughts were a wild turmoil; he shook his head, but the crazy spinning kept up. He couldn't make his mind slow down, lock in place."," \"Wait a minute,\" a voice said. B'prith's voice, from the open doorway. Cold and withdrawn, almost unfamiliar."," \"What do you want?\""," B'prith came toward him, claws behind his back in the formal Pas-udeti posture, used between total strangers. \"You shouldn't have come here, today.\""," \"I know,\" Tony said."," B'prith got out a bit of _tis_ stalk and began to roll it into a tube. He pretended to concentrate on it. \"Look,\" he said. \"You said you have a right here. But you don't.\""," \"I--\" Tony murmured."," \"Do you understand why not? You said it isn't your fault. I guess not. But it's not my fault, either. Maybe it's nobody's fault. I've known you a long time.\""," \"Five years. Terran.\""," B'prith twisted the stalk up and tossed it away. \"Yesterday we played together. We worked on the spaceport. But we can't play today. My family said to tell you not to come here any more.\" He hesitated, and did not look Tony in the face. \"I was going to tell you, anyhow. Before they said anything.\""," \"Oh,\" Tony said."," \"Everything that's happened today--the battle, our fleet's stand. We didn't know. We didn't dare hope. You see? A century of running. First this system. Then the Rigel system, all the planets. Then the other Orion stars. We fought here and there--scattered fights. Those that got away joined up. We supplied the base at Orion--you people didn't know. But there was no hope; at least, nobody thought there was.\" He was silent a moment. \"Funny,\" he said, \"what happens when your back's to the wall, and there isn't any further place to go. Then you have to fight.\""," \"If our supply bases--\" Tony began thickly, but B'prith cut him off savagely."," \"Your supply bases! Don't you understand? We're beating you! Now you'll have to get out! All you white-grubs. Out of our system!\""," Tony's EEP moved forward ominously. B'prith saw it. He bent down, snatched up a rock, and hurled it straight at the EEP. The rock clanged off the metal hull and bounced harmlessly away. B'prith snatched up another rock. Llyre and the others came quickly out of the house. An adult Pas loomed up behind them. Everything was happening too fast. More rocks crashed against the EEP. One struck Tony on the arm."," \"Get out!\" B'prith screamed. \"Don't come back! This is our planet!\" His claws snatched at Tony. \"We'll tear you to pieces if you--\""," Tony smashed him in the chest. The soft shell gave like rubber, and the Pas stumbled back. He wobbled and fell over, gasping and screeching."," \"_Beetle_,\" Tony breathed hoarsely. Suddenly he was terrified. A crowd of Pas-udeti was forming rapidly. They surged on all sides, hostile faces, dark and angry, a rising thunder of rage."," More stones showered. Some struck the EEP, others fell around Tony, near his boots. One whizzed past his face. Quickly he slid his helmet in place. He was scared. He knew his EEP's E-signal had already gone out, but it would be minutes before a ship could come. Besides, there were other Earthmen in the city to be taken care of; there were Earthmen all over the planet. In all the cities. On all the twenty-three Betelgeuse planets. On the fourteen Rigel planets. On the other Orion planets."," \"We have to get out of here,\" he muttered to the EEP. \"Do something!\""," A stone hit him on the helmet. The plastic cracked; air leaked out, and then the autoseal filmed over. More stones were falling. The Pas swarmed close, a yelling, seething mass of black-sheathed creatures. He could smell them, the acrid body-odor of insects, hear their claws snap, feel their weight."," The EEP threw its heat beam on. The beam shifted in a wide band toward the crowd of Pas-udeti. Crude hand weapons appeared. A clatter of bullets burst around Tony; they were firing at the EEP. He was dimly aware of the metal body beside him. A shuddering crash--the EEP was toppled over. The crowd poured over it; the metal hull was lost from sight."," Like a demented animal, the crowd tore at the struggling EEP. A few of them smashed in its head; others tore off struts and shiny arm-sections. The EEP ceased struggling. The crowd moved away, panting and clutching jagged remains. They saw Tony."," As the first line of them reached for him, the protective envelope high above them shattered. A Terran scout ship thundered down, heat beam screaming. The crowd scattered in confusion, some firing, some throwing stones, others leaping for safety."," Tony picked himself up and made his way unsteadily toward the spot where the scout was landing."," *****"," \"I'm sorry,\" Joe Rossi said gently. He touched his son on the shoulder. \"I shouldn't have let you go down there today. I should have known.\""," Tony sat hunched over in the big plastic easychair. He rocked back and forth, face pale with shock. The scout ship which had rescued him had immediately headed back toward Karnet; there were other Earthmen to bring out, besides this first load. The boy said nothing. His mind was blank. He still heard the roar of the crowd, felt its hate--a century of pent-up fury and resentment. The memory drove out everything else; it was all around him, even now. And the sight of the floundering EEP, the metallic ripping sound, as its arms and legs were torn off and carried away."," His mother dabbed at his cuts and scratches with antiseptic. Joe Rossi shakily lit a cigarette and said, \"If your EEP hadn't been along they'd have killed you. Beetles.\" He shuddered. \"I never should have let you go down there. All this time.... They might have done it any time, any day. Knifed you. Cut you open with their filthy goddamn claws.\""," Below the settlement the reddish-yellow sunlight glinted on gunbarrels. Already, dull booms echoed against the crumbling hills. The defense ring was going into action. Black shapes darted and scurried up the side of the slope. Black patches moved out from Karnet, toward the Terran settlement, across the dividing line the Confederation surveyors had set up a century ago. Karnet was a bubbling pot of activity. The whole city rumbled with feverish excitement."," Tony raised his head. \"They--they turned our flank.\""," \"Yeah.\" Joe Rossi stubbed out his cigarette. \"They sure did. That was at one o'clock. At two they drove a wedge right through the center of our line. Split the fleet in half. Broke it up--sent it running. Picked us off one by one as we fell back. Christ, they're like maniacs. Now that they've got the scent, the taste of our blood.\""," \"But it's getting better,\" Leah fluttered. \"Our main fleet units are beginning to appear.\""," \"We'll get them,\" Joe muttered. \"It'll take a while. But by God we'll wipe them out. Every last one of them. If it takes a thousand years. We'll follow every last ship down--we'll get them all.\" His voice rose in frenzy. \"Beetles! Goddamn insects! When I think of them, trying to hurt my kid, with their filthy black claws--\""," \"If you were younger, you'd be in the line,\" Leah said. \"It's not your fault you're too old. The heart strain's too great. You did your job. They can't let an older person take chances. It's not your fault.\""," Joe clenched his fists. \"I feel so--futile. If there was only something I could do.\""," \"The fleet will take care of them,\" Leah said soothingly. \"You said so yourself. They'll hunt every one of them down. Destroy them all. There's nothing to worry about.\""," Joe sagged miserably. \"It's no use. Let's cut it out. Let's stop kidding ourselves.\""," \"What do you mean?\""," \"Face it! We're not going to win, not this time. We went too far. Our time's come.\""," There was silence."," Tony sat up a little. \"When did you know?\""," \"I've known a long time.\""," \"I found out today. I didn't understand, at first. This is--stolen ground. I was born here, but it's stolen ground.\""," \"Yes. It's stolen. It doesn't belong to us.\""," \"We're here because we're stronger. But now we're not stronger. We're being beaten.\""," \"They know Terrans can be licked. Like anybody else.\" Joe Rossi's face was gray and flabby. \"We took their planets away from them. Now they're taking them back. It'll be a while, of course. We'll retreat slowly. It'll be another five centuries going back. There're a lot of systems between here and Sol.\""," Tony shook his head, still uncomprehending. \"Even Llyre and B'prith. All of them. Waiting for their time to come. For us to lose and go away again. Where we came from.\""," Joe Rossi paced back and forth. \"Yeah, we'll be retreating from now on. Giving ground, instead of taking it. It'll be like this today--losing fights, draws. Stalemates and worse.\""," He raised his feverish eyes toward the ceiling of the little metal housing unit, face wild with passion and misery."," \"But, by God, we'll give them a run for their money. All the way back! Every inch!\""," "," "],"excerpt":"Reddish-yellow sunlight filtered through the thick quartz windows into the sleep-compartment.

I refused to be soothed no matter what Mom and Dad tried."," Dad gave up and left the bedroom, but Mom took me into the kitchen and sat me down at the breakfast table."," \"Kan, kan,\" she said, as she pulled a sheet of wrapping paper from on top of the fridge. For years, Mom carefully sliced open the wrappings around Christmas gifts and saved them on top of the fridge in a thick stack."," She set the paper down, plain side facing up, and began to fold it. I stopped crying and watched her, curious."," She turned the paper over and folded it again. She pleated, packed, tucked, rolled, and twisted until the paper disappeared between her cupped hands. Then she lifted the folded-up paper packet to her mouth and blew into it, like a balloon."," \"Kan,\" she said. \"Laohu.\" She put her hands down on the table and let go."," A little paper tiger stood on the table, the size of two fists placed together. The skin of the tiger was the pattern on the wrapping paper, white background with red candy canes and green Christmas trees."," I reached out to Mom's creation. Its tail twitched, and it pounced playfully at my finger. \"Rawrr-sa,\" it growled, the sound somewhere between a cat and rustling newspapers."," I laughed, startled, and stroked its back with an index finger. The paper tiger vibrated under my finger, purring."," \"Zhe jiao zhezhi,\" Mom said. This is called origami."," I didn't know this at the time, but Mom's kind was special. She breathed into them so that they shared her breath, and thus moved with her life. This was her magic."," #"," Dad had picked Mom out of a catalog."," One time, when I was in high school, I asked Dad about the details. He was trying to get me to speak to Mom again."," He had signed up for the introduction service back in the spring of 1973. Flipping through the pages steadily, he had spent no more than a few seconds on each page until he saw the picture of Mom."," I've never seen this picture. Dad described it: Mom was sitting in a chair, her side to the camera, wearing a tight green silk cheongsam. Her head was turned to the camera so that her long black hair was draped artfully over her chest and shoulder. She looked out at him with the eyes of a calm child."," \"That was the last page of the catalog I saw,\" he said."," The catalog said she was eighteen, loved to dance, and spoke good English because she was from Hong Kong. None of these facts turned out to be true."," He wrote to her, and the company passed their messages back and forth. Finally, he flew to Hong Kong to meet her."," \"The people at the company had been writing her responses. She didn't know any English other than 'hello' and 'goodbye.'\""," What kind of woman puts herself into a catalog so that she can be bought? The high school me thought I knew so much about everything. Contempt felt good, like wine."," Instead of storming into the office to demand his money back, he paid a waitress at the hotel restaurant to translate for them."," \"She would look at me, her eyes halfway between scared and hopeful, while I spoke. And when the girl began translating what I said, she'd start to smile slowly.\""," He flew back to Connecticut and began to apply for the papers for her to come to him. I was born a year later, in the Year of the Tiger."," #"," At my request, Mom also made a goat, a deer, and a water buffalo out of wrapping paper. They would run around the living room while Laohu chased after them, growling. When he caught them he would press down until the air went out of them and they became just flat, folded-up pieces of paper. I would then have to blow into them to re-inflate them so they could run around some more."," Sometimes, the animals got into trouble. Once, the water buffalo jumped into a dish of soy sauce on the table at dinner. (He wanted to wallow, like a real water buffalo.) I picked him out quickly but the capillary action had already pulled the dark liquid high up into his legs. The sauce-softened legs would not hold him up, and he collapsed onto the table. I dried him out in the sun, but his legs became crooked after that, and he ran around with a limp. Mom eventually wrapped his legs in saran wrap so that he could wallow to his heart's content (just not in soy sauce)."," Also, Laohu liked to pounce at sparrows when he and I played in the backyard. But one time, a cornered bird struck back in desperation and tore his ear. He whimpered and winced as I held him and Mom patched his ear together with tape. He avoided birds after that."," And then one day, I saw a TV documentary about sharks and asked Mom for one of my own. She made the shark, but he flapped about on the table unhappily. I filled the sink with water, and put him in. He swam around and around happily. However, after a while he became soggy and translucent, and slowly sank to the bottom, the folds coming undone. I reached in to rescue him, and all I ended up with was a wet piece of paper."," Laohu put his front paws together at the edge of the sink and rested his head on them. Ears drooping, he made a low growl in his throat that made me feel guilty."," Mom made a new shark for me, this time out of tin foil. The shark lived happily in a large goldfish bowl. Laohu and I liked to sit next to the bowl to watch the tin foil shark chasing the goldfish, Laohu sticking his face up against the bowl on the other side so that I saw his eyes, magnified to the size of coffee cups, staring at me from across the bowl."," #"," When I was ten, we moved to a new house across town. Two of the women neighbors came by to welcome us. Dad served them drinks and then apologized for having to run off to the utility company to straighten out the prior owner's bills. \"Make yourselves at home. My wife doesn't speak much English, so don't think she's being rude for not talking to you.\""," While I read in the dining room, Mom unpacked in the kitchen. The neighbors conversed in the living room, not trying to be particularly quiet."," \"He seems like a normal enough man. Why did he do that?\""," \"Something about the mixing never seems right. The child looks unfinished. Slanty eyes, white face. A little monster.\""," \"Do you think he can speak English?\""," The women hushed. After a while they came into the dining room."," \"Hello there! What's your name?\""," \"Jack,\" I said."," \"That doesn't sound very Chinesey.\""," Mom came into the dining room then. She smiled at the women. The three of them stood in a triangle around me, smiling and nodding at each other, with nothing to say, until Dad came back."," #"," Mark, one of the neighborhood boys, came over with his Star Wars action figures. Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber lit up and he could swing his arms and say, in a tinny voice, \"Use the Force!\" I didn't think the figure looked much like the real Obi-Wan at all."," Together, we watched him repeat this performance five times on the coffee table. \"Can he do anything else?\" I asked."," Mark was annoyed by my question. \"Look at all the details,\" he said."," I looked at the details. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to say."," Mark was disappointed by my response. \"Show me your toys.\""," I didn't have any toys except my paper menagerie. I brought Laohu out from my bedroom. By then he was very worn, patched all over with tape and glue, evidence of the years of repairs Mom and I had done on him. He was no longer as nimble and sure-footed as before. I sat him down on the coffee table. I could hear the skittering steps of the other animals behind in the hallway, timidly peeking into the living room."," \"Xiao laohu,\" I said, and stopped. I switched to English. \"This is Tiger.\" Cautiously, Laohu strode up and purred at Mark, sniffing his hands."," Mark examined the Christmas-wrap pattern of Laohu's skin. \"That doesn't look like a tiger at all. Your Mom makes toys for you from trash?\""," I had never thought of Laohu as trash. But looking at him now, he was really just a piece of wrapping paper."," Mark pushed Obi-Wan's head again. The lightsaber flashed; he moved his arms up and down. \"Use the Force!\""," Laohu turned and pounced, knocking the plastic figure off the table. It hit the floor and broke, and Obi-Wan's head rolled under the couch. \"Rawwww,\" Laohu laughed. I joined him."," Mark punched me, hard. \"This was very expensive! You can't even find it in the stores now. It probably cost more than what your dad paid for your mom!\""," I stumbled and fell to the floor. Laohu growled and leapt at Mark's face."," Mark screamed, more out of fear and surprise than pain. Laohu was only made of paper, after all."," Mark grabbed Laohu and his snarl was choked off as Mark crumpled him in his hand and tore him in half. He balled up the two pieces of paper and threw them at me. \"Here's your stupid cheap Chinese garbage.\""," After Mark left, I spent a long time trying, without success, to tape together the pieces, smooth out the paper, and follow the creases to refold Laohu. Slowly, the other animals came into the living room and gathered around us, me and the torn wrapping paper that used to be Laohu."," #"," My fight with Mark didn't end there. Mark was popular at school. I never want to think again about the two weeks that followed."," I came home that Friday at the end of the two weeks. \"Xuexiao hao ma?\" Mom asked. I said nothing and went to the bathroom. I looked into the mirror. I look nothing like her, nothing."," At dinner I asked Dad, \"Do I have a chink face?\""," Dad put down his chopsticks. Even though I had never told him what happened in school, he seemed to understand. He closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \"No, you don't.\""," Mom looked at Dad, not understanding. She looked back at me. \"Sha jiao chink?\""," \"English,\" I said. \"Speak English.\""," She tried. \"What happen?\""," I pushed the chopsticks and the bowl before me away: stir-fried green peppers with five-spice beef. \"We should eat American food.\""," Dad tried to reason. \"A lot of families cook Chinese sometimes.\""," \"We are not other families.\" I looked at him. Other families don't have moms who don't belong."," He looked away. And then he put a hand on Mom's shoulder. \"I'll get you a cookbook.\""," Mom turned to me. \"Bu haochi?\""," \"English,\" I said, raising my voice. \"Speak English.\""," Mom reached out to touch my forehead, feeling for my temperature. \"Fashao la?\""," I brushed her hand away. \"I'm fine. Speak English!\" I was shouting."," \"Speak English to him,\" Dad said to Mom. \"You knew this was going to happen some day. What did you expect?\""," Mom dropped her hands to her side. She sat, looking from Dad to me, and back to Dad again. She tried to speak, stopped, and tried again, and stopped again."," \"You have to,\" Dad said. \"I've been too easy on you. Jack needs to fit in.\""," Mom looked at him. \"If I say 'love,' I feel here.\" She pointed to her lips. \"If I say 'ai,' I feel here.\" She put her hand over her heart."," Dad shook his head. \"You are in America.\""," Mom hunched down in her seat, looking like the water buffalo when Laohu used to pounce on him and squeeze the air of life out of him."," \"And I want some real toys.\""," #"," Dad bought me a full set of Star Wars action figures. I gave the Obi-Wan Kenobi to Mark."," I packed the paper menagerie in a large shoebox and put it under the bed."," The next morning, the animals had escaped and took over their old favorite spots in my room. I caught them all and put them back into the shoebox, taping the lid shut. But the animals made so much noise in the box that I finally shoved it into the corner of the attic as far away from my room as possible."," If Mom spoke to me in Chinese, I refused to answer her. After a while, she tried to use more English. But her accent and broken sentences embarrassed me. I tried to correct her. Eventually, she stopped speaking altogether if I were around."," Mom began to mime things if she needed to let me know something. She tried to hug me the way she saw American mothers did on TV. I thought her movements exaggerated, uncertain, ridiculous, graceless. She saw that I was annoyed, and stopped."," \"You shouldn't treat your mother that way,\" Dad said. But he couldn't look me in the eyes as he said it. Deep in his heart, he must have realized that it was a mistake to have tried to take a Chinese peasant girl and expect her to fit in the suburbs of Connecticut."," Mom learned to cook American style. I played video games and studied French."," Every once in a while, I would see her at the kitchen table studying the plain side of a sheet of wrapping paper. Later a new paper animal would appear on my nightstand and try to cuddle up to me. I caught them, squeezed them until the air went out of them, and then stuffed them away in the box in the attic."," Mom finally stopped making the animals when I was in high school. By then her English was much better, but I was already at that age when I wasn't interested in what she had to say whatever language she used."," Sometimes, when I came home and saw her tiny body busily moving about in the kitchen, singing a song in Chinese to herself, it was hard for me to believe that she gave birth to me. We had nothing in common. She might as well be from the moon. I would hurry on to my room, where I could continue my all-American pursuit of happiness."," #"," Dad and I stood, one on each side of Mom, lying on the hospital bed. She was not yet even forty, but she looked much older."," For years she had refused to go to the doctor for the pain inside her that she said was no big deal. By the time an ambulance finally carried her in, the cancer had spread far beyond the limits of surgery."," My mind was not in the room. It was the middle of the on-campus recruiting season, and I was focused on resumes, transcripts, and strategically constructed interview schedules. I schemed about how to lie to the corporate recruiters most effectively so that they'll offer to buy me. I understood intellectually that it was terrible to think about this while your mother lay dying. But that understanding didn't mean I could change how I felt."," She was conscious. Dad held her left hand with both of his own. He leaned down to kiss her forehead. He seemed weak and old in a way that startled me. I realized that I knew almost as little about Dad as I did about Mom."," Mom smiled at him. \"I'm fine.\""," She turned to me, still smiling. \"I know you have to go back to school.\" Her voice was very weak and it was difficult to hear her over the hum of the machines hooked up to her. \"Go. Don't worry about me. This is not a big deal. Just do well in school.\""," I reached out to touch her hand, because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. I was relieved. I was already thinking about the flight back, and the bright California sunshine."," She whispered something to Dad. He nodded and left the room."," \"Jack, if — \" she was caught up in a fit of coughing, and could not speak for some time. \"If I don't make it, don't be too sad and hurt your health. Focus on your life. Just keep that box you have in the attic with you, and every year, at Qingming, just take it out and think about me. I'll be with you always.\""," Qingming was the Chinese Festival for the Dead. When I was very young, Mom used to write a letter on Qingming to her dead parents back in China, telling them the good news about the past year of her life in America. She would read the letter out loud to me, and if I made a comment about something, she would write it down in the letter too. Then she would fold the letter into a paper crane, and release it, facing west. We would then watch, as the crane flapped its crisp wings on its long journey west, towards the Pacific, towards China, towards the graves of Mom's family."," It had been many years since I last did that with her."," \"I don't know anything about the Chinese calendar,\" I said. \"Just rest, Mom. \""," \"Just keep the box with you and open it once in a while. Just open — \" she began to cough again."," \"It's okay, Mom.\" I stroked her arm awkwardly."," \"Haizi, mama ai ni — \" Her cough took over again. An image from years ago flashed into my memory: Mom saying ai and then putting her hand over her heart."," \"Alright, Mom. Stop talking.\""," Dad came back, and I said that I needed to get to the airport early because I didn't want to miss my flight."," She died when my plane was somewhere over Nevada."," #"," Dad aged rapidly after Mom died. The house was too big for him and had to be sold. My girlfriend Susan and I went to help him pack and clean the place."," Susan found the shoebox in the attic. The paper menagerie, hidden in the uninsulated darkness of the attic for so long, had become brittle and the bright wrapping paper patterns had faded."," \"I've never seen origami like this,\" Susan said. \"Your Mom was an amazing artist.\""," The paper animals did not move. Perhaps whatever magic had animated them stopped when Mom died. Or perhaps I had only imagined that these paper constructions were once alive. The memory of children could not be trusted."," #"," It was the first weekend in April, two years after Mom's death. Susan was out of town on one of her endless trips as a management consultant and I was home, lazily flipping through the TV channels."," I paused at a documentary about sharks. Suddenly I saw, in my mind, Mom's hands, as they folded and refolded tin foil to make a shark for me, while Laohu and I watched."," A rustle. I looked up and saw that a ball of wrapping paper and torn tape was on the floor next to the bookshelf. I walked over to pick it up for the trash."," The ball of paper shifted, unfurled itself, and I saw that it was Laohu, who I hadn't thought about in a very long time. \"Rawrr-sa.\" Mom must have put him back together after I had given up."," He was smaller than I remembered. Or maybe it was just that back then my fists were smaller."," Susan had put the paper animals around our apartment as decoration. She probably left Laohu in a pretty hidden corner because he looked so shabby."," I sat down on the floor, and reached out a finger. Laohu's tail twitched, and he pounced playfully. I laughed, stroking his back. Laohu purred under my hand."," \"How've you been, old buddy?\""," Laohu stopped playing. He got up, jumped with feline grace into my lap, and proceeded to unfold himself."," In my lap was a square of creased wrapping paper, the plain side up. It was filled with dense Chinese characters. I had never learned to read Chinese, but I knew the characters for son, and they were at the top, where you'd expect them in a letter addressed to you, written in Mom's awkward, childish handwriting."," I went to the computer to check the Internet. Today was Qingming."," #"," I took the letter with me downtown, where I knew the Chinese tour buses stopped. I stopped every tourist, asking, \"Nin hui du zhongwen ma?\" Can you read Chinese? I hadn't spoken Chinese in so long that I wasn't sure if they understood."," A young woman agreed to help. We sat down on a bench together, and she read the letter to me aloud. The language that I had tried to forget for years came back, and I felt the words sinking into me, through my skin, through my bones, until they squeezed tight around my heart."," #"," Son,"," We haven't talked in a long time. You are so angry when I try to touch you that I'm afraid. And I think maybe this pain I feel all the time now is something serious."," So I decided to write to you. I'm going to write in the paper animals I made for you that you used to like so much."," The animals will stop moving when I stop breathing. But if I write to you with all my heart, I'll leave a little of myself behind on this paper, in these words. Then, if you think of me on Qingming, when the spirits of the departed are allowed to visit their families, you'll make the parts of myself I leave behind come alive too. The creatures I made for you will again leap and run and pounce, and maybe you'll get to see these words then."," Because I have to write with all my heart, I need to write to you in Chinese."," All this time I still haven't told you the story of my life. When you were little, I always thought I'd tell you the story when you were older, so you could understand. But somehow that chance never came up."," I was born in 1957, in Sigulu Village, Hebei Province. Your grandparents were both from very poor peasant families with few relatives. Only a few years after I was born, the Great Famines struck China, during which thirty million people died. The first memory I have was waking up to see my mother eating dirt so that she could fill her belly and leave the last bit of flour for me."," Things got better after that. Sigulu is famous for its zhezhi papercraft, and my mother taught me how to make paper animals and give them life. This was practical magic in the life of the village. We made paper birds to chase grasshoppers away from the fields, and paper tigers to keep away the mice. For Chinese New Year my friends and I made red paper dragons. I'll never forget the sight of all those little dragons zooming across the sky overhead, holding up strings of exploding firecrackers to scare away all the bad memories of the past year. You would have loved it."," Then came the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Neighbor turned on neighbor, and brother against brother. Someone remembered that my mother's brother, my uncle, had left for Hong Kong back in 1946, and became a merchant there. Having a relative in Hong Kong meant we were spies and enemies of the people, and we had to be struggled against in every way. Your poor grandmother — she couldn't take the abuse and threw herself down a well. Then some boys with hunting muskets dragged your grandfather away one day into the woods, and he never came back."," There I was, a ten-year-old orphan. The only relative I had in the world was my uncle in Hong Kong. I snuck away one night and climbed onto a freight train going south."," Down in Guangdong Province a few days later, some men caught me stealing food from a field. When they heard that I was trying to get to Hong Kong, they laughed. \"It's your lucky day. Our trade is to bring girls to Hong Kong.\""," They hid me in the bottom of a truck along with other girls, and smuggled us across the border."," We were taken to a basement and told to stand up and look healthy and intelligent for the buyers. Families paid the warehouse a fee and came by to look us over and select one of us to \"adopt.\""," The Chin family picked me to take care of their two boys. I got up every morning at four to prepare breakfast. I fed and bathed the boys. I shopped for food. I did the laundry and swept the floors. I followed the boys around and did their bidding. At night I was locked into a cupboard in the kitchen to sleep. If I was slow or did anything wrong I was beaten. If the boys did anything wrong I was beaten. If I was caught trying to learn English I was beaten."," \"Why do you want to learn English?\" Mr. Chin asked. \"You want to go to the police? We'll tell the police that you are a mainlander illegally in Hong Kong. They'd love to have you in their prison.\""," Six years I lived like this. One day, an old woman who sold fish to me in the morning market pulled me aside."," \"I know girls like you. How old are you now, sixteen? One day, the man who owns you will get drunk, and he'll look at you and pull you to him and you can't stop him. The wife will find out, and then you will think you really have gone to hell. You have to get out of this life. I know someone who can help.\""," She told me about American men who wanted Asian wives. If I can cook, clean, and take care of my American husband, he'll give me a good life. It was the only hope I had. And that was how I got into the catalog with all those lies and met your father. It is not a very romantic story, but it is my story."," In the suburbs of Connecticut, I was lonely. Your father was kind and gentle with me, and I was very grateful to him. But no one understood me, and I understood nothing."," But then you were born! I was so happy when I looked into your face and saw shades of my mother, my father, and myself. I had lost my entire family, all of Sigulu, everything I ever knew and loved. But there you were, and your face was proof that they were real. I hadn't made them up."," Now I had someone to talk to. I would teach you my language, and we could together remake a small piece of everything that I loved and lost. When you said your first words to me, in Chinese that had the same accent as my mother and me, I cried for hours. When I made the first zhezhi animals for you, and you laughed, I felt there were no worries in the world."," You grew up a little, and now you could even help your father and I talk to each other. I was really at home now. I finally found a good life. I wished my parents could be here, so that I could cook for them, and give them a good life too. But my parents were no longer around. You know what the Chinese think is the saddest feeling in the world? It's for a child to finally grow the desire to take care of his parents, only to realize that they were long gone."," Son, I know that you do not like your Chinese eyes, which are my eyes. I know that you do not like your Chinese hair, which is my hair. But can you understand how much joy your very existence brought to me? And can you understand how it felt when you stopped talking to me and won't let me talk to you in Chinese? I felt I was losing everything all over again."," Why won't you talk to me, son? The pain makes it hard to write."," #"," The young woman handed the paper back to me. I could not bear to look into her face."," Without looking up, I asked for her help in tracing out the character for ai on the paper below Mom's letter. I wrote the character again and again on the paper, intertwining my pen strokes with her words."," The young woman reached out and put a hand on my shoulder. Then she got up and left, leaving me alone with my mother."," Following the creases, I refolded the paper back into Laohu. I cradled him in the crook of my arm, and as he purred, we began the walk home."," Copyright (c) 2011 Ken Liu, first published in THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY & SCIENCE FICTION, Mar/Apr. 2011."],"excerpt":"One of my earliest memories starts with me sobbing.

That was all. She had put it aside, one cent and then another and then another, in her careful buying of meat and other food. Della counted it three times. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas."," There was nothing to do but fall on the bed and cry. So Della did it."," While the lady of the home is slowly growing quieter, we can look at the home. Furnished rooms at a cost of $8 a week. There is little more to say about it."," In the hall below was a letter-box too small to hold a letter. There was an electric bell, but it could not make a sound. Also there was a name beside the door: “Mr. James Dillingham Young.” "," When the name was placed there, Mr. James Dillingham Young was being paid $30 a week. Now, when he was being paid only $20 a week, the name seemed too long and important. It should perhaps have been “Mr. James D. Young.” But when Mr. James Dillingham Young entered the furnished rooms, his name became very short indeed. Mrs. James Dillingham Young put her arms warmly about him and called him “Jim.” You have already met her. She is Della."," Della finished her crying and cleaned the marks of it from her face. She stood by the window and looked out with no interest. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a gift. She had put aside as much as she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week is not much. Everything had cost more than she had expected. It always happened like that."," Only $ 1.87 to buy a gift for Jim. Her Jim. She had had many happy hours planning something nice for him. Something nearly good enough."," Something almost worth the honor of belonging to Jim."," There was a looking-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen the kind of looking-glass that is placed in $8 furnished rooms. It was very narrow. A person could see only a little of himself at a time. However, if he was very thin and moved very quickly, he might be able to get a good view of himself. Della, being quite thin, had mastered this art."," Suddenly she turned from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brightly, but her face had lost its color. Quickly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its complete length."," The James Dillingham Youngs were very proud of two things which they owned. One thing was Jim’s gold watch. It had once belonged to his father. And, long ago, it had belonged to his father’s father. The other thing was Della’s hair."," If a queen had lived in the rooms near theirs, Della would have washed and dried her hair where the queen could see it. Della knew her hair was more beautiful than any queen’s jewels and gifts."," If a king had lived in the same house, with all his riches, Jim would have looked at his watch every time they met. Jim knew that no king had anything so valuable."," So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her, shining like a falling stream of brown water. It reached below her knee. It almost made itself into a dress for her."," And then she put it up on her head again, nervously and quickly. Once she stopped for a moment and stood still while a tear or two ran down her face."," She put on her old brown coat. She put on her old brown hat. With the bright light still in her eyes, she moved quickly out the door and down to the street."," Where she stopped, the sign said: “Mrs. Sofronie. Hair Articles of all Kinds.”"," Up to the second floor Della ran, and stopped to get her breath."," Mrs. Sofronie, large, too white, cold-eyed, looked at her."," “Will you buy my hair?” asked Della."," “I buy hair,” said Mrs. Sofronie. “Take your hat off and let me look at it.”"," Down fell the brown waterfall."," “Twenty dollars,” said Mrs. Sofronie, lifting the hair to feel its weight."," “Give it to me quick,” said Della."," Oh, and the next two hours seemed to fly. She was going from one shop to another, to find a gift for Jim."," She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the shops, and she had looked in every shop in the city."," It was a gold watch chain, very simply made. Its value was in its rich and pure material. Because it was so plain and simple, you knew that it was very valuable. All good things are like this."," It was good enough for The Watch."," As soon as she saw it, she knew that Jim must have it. It was like him. Quietness and value—Jim and the chain both had quietness and value. She paid twenty-one dollars for it. And she hurried home with the chain and eighty-seven cents."," With that chain on his watch, Jim could look at his watch and learn the time anywhere he might be. Though the watch was so fine, it had never had a fine chain. He sometimes took it out and looked at it only when no one could see him do it."," When Della arrived home, her mind quieted a little. She began to think more reasonably. She started to try to cover the sad marks of what she had done. Love and large-hearted giving, when added together, can leave deep marks. It is never easy to cover these marks, dear friends— never easy."," Within forty minutes her head looked a little better. With her short hair, she looked wonderfully like a schoolboy. She stood at the looking-glass for a long time."," “If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he looks at me a second time, he’ll say I look like a girl who sings and dances for money. But what could I do—oh! What could I do with a dollar and eightyseven cents?”"," At seven, Jim’s dinner was ready for him."," Jim was never late. Della held the watch chain in her hand and sat near the door where he always entered. Then she heard his step in the hall and her face lost color for a moment. She often said little prayers quietly, about simple everyday things. And now she said: “Please God, make him think I’m still pretty.”"," The door opened and Jim stepped in. He looked very thin and he was not smiling. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and with a family to take care of! He needed a new coat and he had nothing to cover his cold hands."," Jim stopped inside the door. He was as quiet as a hunting dog when it is near a bird. His eyes looked strangely at Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not understand. It filled her with fear. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor anything she had been ready for. He simply looked at her with that strange expression on his face. Della went to him."," “Jim, dear,” she cried, “don’t look at me like that. I had my hair cut off and sold it. I couldn’t live through Christmas without giving you a gift. My hair will grow again. You won’t care, will you? My hair grows very fast. It’s Christmas, Jim. Let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful nice gift I got for you.” “You’ve cut off your hair?” asked Jim slowly. He seemed to labor to understand what had happened. He seemed not to feel sure he knew."," “Cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me now? I’m me, Jim. I’m the same without my hair.”"," Jim looked around the room."," “You say your hair is gone?” he said."," “You don’t have to look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you— sold and gone, too. It’s the night before Christmas, boy. Be good to me, because I sold it for you. Maybe the hairs of my head could be counted,” she said, “but no one could ever count my love for you. Shall we eat dinner, Jim?”"," Jim put his arms around his Della. For ten seconds let us look in another direction. Eight dollars a week or a million dollars a year— how different are they? Someone may give you an answer, but it will be wrong. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. My meaning will be explained soon."," From inside the coat, Jim took something tied in paper. He threw it upon the table."," “I want you to understand me, Dell,” he said. “Nothing like a haircut could make me love you any less. But if you’ll open that, you may know what I felt when I came in.” White fingers pulled off the paper. And then a cry of joy; and then a change to tears."," For there lay The Combs—the combs that Della had seen in a shop window and loved for a long time. Beautiful combs, with jewels, perfect for her beautiful hair. She had known they cost too much for her to buy them. She had looked at them without the least hope of owning them. And now they were hers, but her hair was gone."," But she held them to her heart, and at last was able to look up and say: “My hair grows so fast, Jim!” And then she jumped up and cried, “Oh, oh!” Jim had not yet seen his beautiful gift. She held it out to him in her open hand. The gold seemed to shine softly as if with her own warm and loving spirit."," “Isn’t it perfect, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You’ll have to look at your watch a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how they look together.”"," Jim sat down and smiled."," “Della,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas gifts away and keep them a while. They’re too nice to use now. I sold the watch to get the money to buy the combs. And now I think we should have our dinner.”"," The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men— who brought gifts to the newborn Christ-child. They were the first to give Christmas gifts. Being wise, their gifts were doubtless wise ones. And here I have told you the story of two children who were not wise. Each sold the most valuable thing he owned in order to buy a gift for the other. But let me speak a last word to the wise of these days: Of all who give gifts, these two were the most wise. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are the most wise. Everywhere they are the wise ones."," They are the magi."],"excerpt":"ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS. That was all.
